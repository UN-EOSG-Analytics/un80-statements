k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",46,SLV,El Salvador,,Permanent Representative,,2,1,"So I take this opportunity also to make that call and that we must be serious, disciplined and ready to do our part."

k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",46,SLV,El Salvador,,Permanent Representative,,3,2,"And in that regards, we urge you Co Chairs to structure this group's work holistically, drawing, as many other colleagues have mentioned before, drawing from lessons from past processes, but also ensuring applicability across the organization's principals and subsidiary bodies."
k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",46,SLV,El Salvador,,Permanent Representative,,3,3,"So in other words, our task is not to reinvigorate the wheel, but to make it run faster and more effectively."
k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",46,SLV,El Salvador,,Permanent Representative,,3,4,We also call for realism in scheduling.

k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",46,SLV,El Salvador,,Permanent Representative,,5,0,"And finally, this initiative must be forward looking."

k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",73,NOR,Norway,,Representative,,1,0,Let me just quickly emphasize three main points.
k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",73,NOR,Norway,,Representative,,1,1,"First, let me stress that the SG report on Mandate Implementation Review serves as a very helpful entry point for us as Member States and in the negotiation process because it expands the scope of the concept of mandate implementation by including both the design or the creation phase and also the review phase of implementation of the mandates."
k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",73,NOR,Norway,,Representative,,1,2,"And most importantly, it advances a perspective on systemic improvements by focusing on some key guiding principles, uninformed options."
k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",73,NOR,Norway,,Representative,,1,3,"As part of that, I'm stressing this because we will support from our side a process that is forward looking and which has a broad scope, setting a new standard for mandate creation, implementation and review and the methodology for that."
k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",73,NOR,Norway,,Representative,,1,4,"Our key goal for this phase should therefore be to agree on some of these guiding principles that will have a positive and very concrete impact on the future design of mandates and the life cycles of the mandates, which collectively can help us together to address what is today the structural problem, and that's the propitiation of overlapping and duplicative mandates."
k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",73,NOR,Norway,,Representative,,2,0,"My second key point, and that's briefly on your three guiding questions."
k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",73,NOR,Norway,,Representative,,2,1,I mean very many good constructive ideas have been raised in the meeting.
k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",73,NOR,Norway,,Representative,,2,2,I think from our side we just want to say that we believe it's crucial to combine two sets of key elements in this first is to ensure inclusivity throughout the process and that's first and foremost related to us as Member States.
k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",73,NOR,Norway,,Representative,,2,3,So all Member States must be enabled and able to participate full.
k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",73,NOR,Norway,,Representative,,2,4,So it has to be transparent.
k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",73,NOR,Norway,,Representative,,3,0,"But it also has to involve a very significant support role, not by Guy Ryder himself, but his very well staffed team and the Secretariat throughout all the stages by providing what he also stressed is substantive support."
k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",73,NOR,Norway,,Representative,,4,0,"The second element is clearly to secure, and we don't have yet any strong opinions whether it needs by nature to be sequential or whether things could be mixed throughout the process."
k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",73,NOR,Norway,,Representative,,4,1,"But what is key for us is that we must be able to secure a process where both the informal part of negotiations are sufficiently that you as co chairs, sufficiently allow time for that phase."
k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",73,NOR,Norway,,Representative,,4,2,"But secondly, and maybe most importantly is to ensure deep thematic, substantive discussions before going into the nitty gritty details of text based negotiations."
k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",73,NOR,Norway,,Representative,,4,3,"And in that phase, clearly the role of the Secretariat must be protected and supported."
k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",73,NOR,Norway,,Representative,,5,0,"Thirdly, and finally, we as Norway remain very committed to engage with all, I mean with you, but of course with all Member States both across and within regional groups."
k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",73,NOR,Norway,,Representative,,5,1,"And we like both very constructively and creatively to contribute to a truly collective process that must be collective if we're going to succeed by finding an area of convergence and consensus at the end finally, for us it will be vital to find the right balance between all the three main pillars in this work and it cannot be any cherry picking and all three will count as most importantly vis a vis each other."
k1k/k1k41vpaer,Session 1,First meeting of the working group,"Sep 16, 2025",73,NOR,Norway,,Representative,,5,2,"So with those words, thank you and we're looking forward."

k1q/k1q3jsibpv,Session 2,Mandate Creation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 13, 2025",16,LIE,Liechtenstein,,Representative,,2,0,"And my experience is also that we often actually don't know if a mandate that we're drafting is, is linked to a PBI until extremely late."

k1q/k1q3jsibpv,Session 2,Mandate Creation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 13, 2025",16,LIE,Liechtenstein,,Representative,,2,3,But I think the reality is also even without a PBI a resolution does entail costs.

k1q/k1q3jsibpv,Session 2,Mandate Creation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 13, 2025",16,LIE,Liechtenstein,,Representative,,3,2,Think that links also you know the forward looking perspective that that has been advocated in the discussion with what we also need to address as far as what you already have.
k1q/k1q3jsibpv,Session 2,Mandate Creation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 13, 2025",16,LIE,Liechtenstein,,Representative,,3,3,And the second question relates also to my comments namely what additional information can be provided besides regular budget estimates to ensure full funding transparency for newly created mandates.

k1q/k1q3jsibpv,Session 2,Mandate Creation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 13, 2025",18,USA,United States,,Representative,,1,4,And I think it would be useful to have more information on what the that would actually look like if there are examples in existing mandates that perhaps could serve as a model as we consider new mandates.

k1q/k1q3jsibpv,Session 2,Mandate Creation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 13, 2025",18,USA,United States,,Representative,,4,0,"And similarly, should we be thinking about a threshold below which the Secretariat can absorb those resources, or above which resources actually would be necessary for implementation?"

k1q/k1q3jsibpv,Session 2,Mandate Creation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 13, 2025",26,ROU,Romania,,Representative,,3,1,"Because the way I see it, and that's the mirror that we have to look into, we're not even observing our own rules of procedures throughout these processes that we promote through different committees of resolutions."

k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",2,EOSG,EOSG,Ayaka Suzuki,Director,,15,1,"And in fact, that has been the norm over the years and it's only in recent years that it has become more prescriptive."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",2,EOSG,EOSG,Ayaka Suzuki,Director,,15,2,"So what that means is that referring only to the Secretary General, that the United nations or UN system would be the preferred or the easiest way to do assignment based on comparative advantage."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",2,EOSG,EOSG,Ayaka Suzuki,Director,,15,3,"Third, to better support Member States, the Secretary General proposed three main actions."

k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",2,EOSG,EOSG,Ayaka Suzuki,Director,,16,1,"Our suggestion here included using review clauses, consolidating agenda items, or proposing the discontinuation of outdated outputs, which is an authority that the Secretary General intends to make make purposeful use of."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",2,EOSG,EOSG,Ayaka Suzuki,Director,,16,2,"Finally, on the timeline for Secretary General General related actions, many of these actions are already in progress, including the continued improvements of mandates.un.org Fuller implementation is targeted for 2026 in line with the available capacity and resources."

k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,1,0,"You know, adding to what my colleague just said, I'll."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,1,1,I'll take a few more of those questions that were posed to us.
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,1,2,"In particular, there was a few questions that related to what does the Secretariat how does Secretary determine additional resources are needed when mandates are assigned within existing resource mentioned and how is those situations treated?"
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,1,3,"Just want to mention that in such situations, of course, we consult with all the relevant departments to know whether the implementation can be, you know, can be done within the existing resource, whether it can be absorbed, whether the, you know, synergies can be created with already planned activities and determining if reallocation of resources are, you know, are possible while maintaining the commitments and the deliverables that are supporting them and the delivery already."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,1,4,"Just also want to mention that we understand and also from this dialogue that happened last week that, you know, often when there is such mention, it is also a way for the for the Member States to convey to the Secretariat that the expectation is that such a new mandate would not have a lot of additional activities or costly activities associated to it."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,2,0,"It would not consume significant resources and therefore, you know, it would be implementing through leveraging the resources that are already available or have been planned for other activities and build synergies."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,2,1,There was a few questions and I'll answer on aspects of what I would call budgetary techniques that could be used to simplify or use anticipation for a more efficient budgetary process.
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,2,2,"I think that there was a mention, for example, of the concept of threshold."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,2,3,"Whether using threshold to say, under a certain threshold, for example, there is no need to go and present pbis or above a certain threshold, there is the understanding that there wouldn't always be a PBI and there wouldn't be no absorption possible."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,2,4,"So this is not something that we have in place, but it could be something that we can think about with criteria that makes sense so that we avoid ambiguity, a moment of the negotiation of the creation of the mandate."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,3,0,"Also a technique that so far is only used in one area, which could be the inclusion of provision for future program budget implications at the time of preparation of the proposed program budget so that to streamline the mandate resourcing process in, you know, today we are including in the budget only things that have already been approved by Member States without anticipating possible approval."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,3,1,The only area where we do that is on renewal of certain mandates for human rights and we call that the consolidation.
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,3,2,It's been in place now for a few years and it's proven to be quite a useful tool.
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,3,3,It lowers the amount of PBIS that have to be presented in the fall.
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,3,4,And certainly that is a tool that I think could be also an idea that could be considered on the aspect of the mandate creation process.
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,4,0,"There was, I think my colleague already mentioned, you know, how much the addition of tools, the registry of tools that help identifying what's already available not only within the Secretariat is being done, but across the UN system will be extremely useful because today we are not really in a capacity to provide that one is about the mandates."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,4,1,"Also, global information of the funding of those mandates is not necessarily available for the UN system, but we should look into how those tools could be enriched with that information so that at the moment of mandate creation, you have access to this information, but that is not a function that is currently happening within the Secretariat and which is not really resourced neither."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,4,2,So that would be something to be looked into.
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,4,3,"There was also questions related to the possibility we have to understand budgetary implications or that Member States have to understand budgetary implication earlier in the drafting and negotiation process for new mandate, for example, at the stage of the zero draft, rather than waiting at the end of the process when you have more of a final resolution, and that we formally cost it."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,4,4,"So, of course, you know, we could imagine a mechanism where throughout the negotiation there is a support of the Secretariat in terms of the costing of the drafts as they are."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,5,0,"But again, that is one area where today that is not yet how it is being done and how it's being resourced, neither to have a dedicated team that could accompany Member States throughout the different revisions."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,5,1,"That is an idea that is worth exploring, knowing that it would probably have a cost, but it might be worth it because then it would help creating better mandates, probably, or mandates that are calibrated to what the expectations of Member States are."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,5,2,So that was an idea that we also wanted to mention as possible to explore.
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",5,DMSPC,DMSPC,Christophe Monnier,Director,,5,3,"Madam Chair, I think I will stop here, but of course available for more answers."

k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,0,3,I want to thank especially to those of you who asked such fantastic questions to those of us on the panel.
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,0,4,And I'm grateful to be back here to help you think this through.
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,1,0,"As I'd mentioned, I was asked to lead the first UN mandate review 20 years ago when I worked in the office of Secretary General Kofi Annan."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,1,1,And it was an ambitious task and to do.
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,1,2,So I had to form a team.
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,1,3,"And it was a team of about 20, maybe a bit more than that, that included UN staff, including retirees that we pulled back in, student interns to read through UN resolutions, manually type into a database to create the registry, and then people to also look at the, to do the analysis."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,1,4,"And as part of that effort, I personally interviewed everyone I possibly could throughout the Secretariat, Every chief of staff, policy or planning director, head of office, anyone across the system in New York at least, who was willing, this was before zoom, who was willing to meet with me to understand how the UN really worked and how we could help make it work better."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,2,0,"And this culminated in our own mandate registry that we created in 2005, 2006, and an intergovernmental review of all mandates older than five years."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,2,1,"And it totaled over 9,000."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,2,2,That meant that some resolutions had more than one mandate.
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,2,3,But I do want to just emphasize that part of the challenge back then was the mandate creation process itself.
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,2,4,"And maybe that is indicative of the challenge that you have here, because the World Summit outcome which gave the mandate to conduct a mandate review, I quote, and this is the World summit outcome in 2005."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,3,0,"The mandate was, we resolved to strengthen and update the program of work of the United nations so that it, it responds to the contemporary requirements of Member States."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,3,1,"To this end, the General assembly and other relevant organs will review all mandates older than five years, originating from resolutions of the General assembly and other organs which would be complementary to the existing periodic reviews of activities."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,3,2,So the original mandate for that 2006 mandate review was to review all mandates older than five years.
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,3,3,So it was not because the Member States decided to take a different path.
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,3,4,"This was the mandate that they had given, that you all had given yourselves back then."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,4,0,And so what I learned from those discussions is really what I bring to this.
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,4,1,"I'm not an expert on management reform, at least not anymore."

k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,4,3,"Or am I versed in how the Secretariat currently manages the budgets, which you already have the Secretary of Staff here to do?"
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,4,4,"But I did speak to many UN evaluation experts and many, many people, including heads of offices and chiefs of staff throughout the system."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,5,0,"When we last met, a number of Member states asked me how this mandate implementation review can be successful where the previous one had fallen short."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,5,1,"And I think the first one is that you are not bound by a mandate that you all had issued yourselves to review past mandates, but that you actually have the flexibility now and the opportunity to look forward, to try to figure out and really fix the mandate creation, delivering and review cycle."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,5,2,One of you had noted last time that we have the tools today that the team in 2005 and six were unable to offer.

k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,5,4,"You also have a much more advanced mandate resource registry that, as you've heard from Ms. Suzuki, that the Secretariat has created."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,6,0,"As I mentioned, 20 years ago, we also had a mandate registry that was manually populated, and Member States found in those consultations that the mandates that we identified lacked and evaluative and budgetary information."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,6,1,And it sounds like that is still a challenge.
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,6,2,"How then can we make sure that today's mandate Registry provides you, the Member States, with the information that you need?"
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,6,3,What information does it currently provide?
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,6,4,"Right now, as you've heard, the mandate Registry allows you to search information on almost 4,000 active mandates that parts of the UN system are citing in their program budget requests."

k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,7,1,"So, as an example, if you look at the issue of debt relief, for instance, because especially we're only four months after the fourth International Conference on Financing for Development, which I was involved in, debt relief was obviously a big issue in FFD this year if Member States were considering a new resolution on debt relief."
k1w/k1w9g0n7gs,Session 3,Mandate Creation consultations - Statements from members of the working group,"Oct 23, 2025",7,Project Starling,Project Starling,Min Thu Pham,Founder & CEO,,7,2,"If you look through the current mandate registry, a quick search shows you that there are 18 existing mandate source documents issued by two UN organs and cited 38 times by 15 UN entities."

k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Beneveso,Permanent Representative,,9,0,"So in our view, the triple IM and the Veto initiative clearly create mandates, and I have already talked about E voting with respect to whether that is a mandate or not."

k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",30,ZAF,South Africa,,Representative,,2,2,"So looking at independent bodies as part of that system wide thing, then on the misaligned funding modalities that entrenches fragmentation, one of the in the report itself, one of the recommendation there was that the outcome of UNAD pillar 3 is going to assist and we fully agree with that and therefore say we need to look at how we deal with that pillar three carefully because then it's going to help us in dealing with this particular challenge of misaligned finding modalities that entrenches fragmentation."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",30,ZAF,South Africa,,Representative,,2,3,"Then lastly, Resolution 79327 on the revitalization of the GA, the work of the GA was mentioned a couple of times and it had a whole section on working methods and some of the recommendations that are there in the report, some of the issues that have been raised are also addressed in that resolution."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",30,ZAF,South Africa,,Representative,,2,4,"So we are wondering if maybe that can be lifted and can be demonstrated how do we further integrate again so that you don't you know that resolution is nowhere there and this UNAIDS over here, how do we integrate and show interconnectedness between the outcomes of that resolution and what we are trying to do here?"

k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",32,KEN,Kenya,,Representative,,0,0,"Thank you, co chairs."

k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",32,KEN,Kenya,,Representative,,1,0,So it's always good listening to brother Ambassador Martin Kimani.

k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",32,KEN,Kenya,,Representative,,1,2,"Of fragmentation, underfunding and limited accountability while."

k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",32,KEN,Kenya,,Representative,,1,4,"In this regard then, I wish to place about two questions."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",32,KEN,Kenya,,Representative,,2,0,"One, on financing, how will the reforms."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",32,KEN,Kenya,,Representative,,2,1,"Ensure that newly approved or renewed mandates are matched with predictable, sustainable and adequate financing to avoid persistent implementation gaps?"
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",32,KEN,Kenya,,Representative,,2,2,"Two, on coherence and efficiency, what mechanisms will be introduced to reduce duplication and fragmentation among entities delivering similar mandates?"
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",32,KEN,Kenya,,Representative,,2,3,"And lastly on accountability and performance, what."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",32,KEN,Kenya,,Representative,,2,4,"Result based metrics or performance frameworks will be adopted to monitor progress, measure impact and ensure that mandate implementation is effectively evaluated beyond financial compliance?"
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",32,KEN,Kenya,,Representative,,3,0,I thank you.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",32,KEN,Kenya,,Representative,,3,1,I thank the distinguished representative of Kenya.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",32,KEN,Kenya,,Representative,,3,2,"I give the floor now to Singapore, followed by Argentina."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",32,KEN,Kenya,,Representative,,3,3,"Thank you very much, coaches."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",32,KEN,Kenya,,Representative,,3,4,"This has been a very useful discussion and I thank the presenters, the panelists for their perspectives."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,0,0,I think each one of us has tabled resolutions as our national initiatives and our national contribution to the work of the un.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,0,1,So each one of us has an interest in the issue of implementation.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,0,2,And naturally each one of us will have a different perspective.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,0,3,"But if we do not collectively agree on some ways to reduce the number of reports, the length of reports and the number of meetings, and the length of meetings, then we would all have collectively failed."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,0,4,"1,100 reports a year plus 27,000 meetings a year is simply overwhelming for many small delegations, including mine."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,1,0,So that is the perspective from which we are approaching this.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,1,1,"Not with a view to prioritizing or deprioritizing certain issues, but how do we collectively find a way to make our work more effective?"
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,1,2,So here I have three questions.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,1,3,"First, with regard to annual reports, About 60% of the annual reports recur, or rather reports recur 60% of them."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,1,4,"My question is, to what extent are these reports almost identical?"
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,2,0,"In other words, if a report is produced with very little substantial changes or modifications, you know, there must be a way of measuring that."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,2,1,"So if it's largely identical, how many percentage of that 60% of reports that recur?"
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,2,2,"I mean, if some estimation of that I think will be useful for us to give a sense as to whether we need an annual update that is largely identical."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,2,3,So that's where we can go into differentiated formats.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,2,4,Maybe a two page executive summary update of a previous annual report.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,3,0,So that's the first set of question.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,3,1,Second question relates to a request for a report.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,4,0,How many instances are there or how often is it the case that a request for report leads to a duplication of reports within the UN system?
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,4,1,"So we request the SG for a report, but that could also prompt a series of agencies to also produce their own report."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,4,2,"And that I think is not a very helpful situation because when we make a request to the sg, we want to see a coherent coordinated report from the UN system, not a series of reports."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,4,3,And but I want to get some data as to whether this is a big issue of duplication or multiplicity of reports on a specific question when there is a request.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,4,4,I think if some data can be shared with us that would be useful.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,5,0,Then the third question comment relates to the question of issue of downloaded reports.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,5,1,"I mean there were some statistics about, you know, some that are downloaded more than others."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,5,2,"Yes, I agree that more downloads does not make it more important an issue."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,5,3,But I think still some data will be useful for me and my delegation to know what are the thematic issues on which there's greater downloading as opposed to other issues.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,5,4,"Because if a report is not downloaded very often, not that we do away with the report, but we need to examine why are those requests being made, say for an important issue but nobody's reading them, then something's wrong with us."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,6,0,"If we are producing reports that are important and no one's reading them, I mean that's a serious issue that we need to collectively address."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,6,1,But I think as a starting point we need also some data we could use.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,6,2,And I guess the final point I want to make is more an observation.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,6,3,Very good to see you Martin.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,6,4,I think very interesting presentation that you made.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,7,0,I think this is an issue that I think we have discussed for some time.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,7,1,"The only glimmer of hope I sense is that with AI as a tool, hopefully we know what we know and hopefully we know where to look for what we do not know."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,7,2,"But AI is not the solution in its entirety, but it can be a very important tool."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,7,3,So that gives me some hope.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,7,4,But my question though is to what extent is the UN designed to utilize AI as a tool for information or knowledge management as you put it?
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,8,0,"I mean this is a large question, but the question is what do we need to do as the UN to make it future ready that's a very broad question for reflection."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",33,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,8,1,Thank you very much to the co chairs and all the panelists.

k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",35,ARG,Argentina,,Representative,,0,1,I have one specific question and it's about one of the proposed solutions that the reports provide regarding I would say the fragmentation or duplication and it's number two when it says ensure UN entities review mandate citations in their programs and budgets so that entities only cite mandates for which they have demonstrable comparative advantage.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",35,ARG,Argentina,,Representative,,0,2,"So maybe if in a later stage chair, we could have maybe more insights on how those manned citations are done within the Secretary, but also the role of Member states."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",35,ARG,Argentina,,Representative,,0,3,"I know that the CPC might have a role to play there, but maybe there are other instances where we can address this issue more in deep and maybe the answers will help us to have a also proposal for next meeting."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",35,ARG,Argentina,,Representative,,0,4,Thank you.

k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",37,USA,United States,,Representative,,0,0,"Thanks so much, Ambassador. And I realize I'm last and came."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",37,USA,United States,,Representative,,0,1,"In late, so I'll try to be."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",37,USA,United States,,Representative,,1,0,"Quick, but I wanted to make a connection to something that we were speaking about in the last session when we were looking at mandate creation."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",37,USA,United States,,Representative,,1,1,And I think much of the discussion on reports sort of bridges both that discussion and this discussion.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",37,USA,United States,,Representative,,1,2,One caveat.
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",37,USA,United States,,Representative,,1,3,"I think at times the metric of how often a report gets downloaded can be a bit misleading because there are a number of very technical meetings, often with a small number of delegates who need that report to inform their deliberations."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",37,USA,United States,,Representative,,1,4,"For example, I am going to guess that very few Fifth Committee reports get read outside of the Fifth Committee, and yet they're essential to to the work of the fifth committee."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",37,USA,United States,,Representative,,2,0,"So the downloading of 2,000 reports as a metric might be a misnomer, but I do think the quality of the reports is critical and I want to compliment the Executive Office of the Secretary General for the quality of the reports that have been provided to us on UN80."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",37,USA,United States,,Representative,,2,1,"I think both the analysis, but even more importantly the way that data is presented, the use of visuals, tables, graphs that I think are light years above the sort of standard quality of information presentation that we receive in most UN reports."
k11/k11rftq8ch,Session 4,Mandate Implementation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Oct 30, 2025",37,USA,United States,,Representative,,2,2,"And my question then, and this is not something that needs to be answered now by any means, but what is the obstacle to bringing the quality of data presentation that that we're Getting in the UN 80 reports to all of the rest of reports that we use across the various committees and bodies of the un."

k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,1,4,"Focusing today, of course, most particularly on the delivery stage of the life cycle."

k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,3,3,So instead I can perhaps use this time to highlight what seemed to us to be some of the key points that we shared and provide just a little bit of context in some areas that may be of relevance.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,3,4,"I want to begin by underlining why the work that is being done here is so critically important, why it is essential that we streamline and strengthen the UN system's mandate delivery."

k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,4,2,You can see that we are projecting that resources across the entirety of of the United nations systems might well shrink by as much as 25% in 2026 next year compared to the levels of 2024.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,4,3,"And I think that provides a very clear message to us that we simply must focus on optimizing processes, eliminating duplications, if we are to continue to serve the people who need our assistance most."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,4,4,"Let me then turn to some more specific aspects in relation to mandate delivery, which is the focus of today's session."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,5,0,The first point that I could perhaps make relates to reports.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,5,1,"Let me again draw your attention to two statistics, two numbers that we've already shared, but is perhaps worth lingering on again."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,5,2,"If you look at this graphic, you will see that a total of 66% of reports cover recurring topics."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,5,3,"Topics have come on, come back again and again, and 46% of our reports are produced either annually or more frequently than annually."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,5,4,"So if you look at the red boxes here, you will see that those two boxes up to 46%, sort of."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,6,0,"In very plain terms, this means that we are spending considerable time and resources writing reports on the same or similar issues in successive years."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,6,1,"And of course, in many cases, this is absolutely necessary and appropriate."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,6,2,"We understand that annual updates are often appropriate and necessary, but that does not or should not disguise the possibility that there may be opportunities to optimize the format, the length or the periodicity of certain reports."

k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,6,4,"On the other hand, and in some instances, to preserve both Member States bandwidth and respect, that and the Secretariat's capacity, it might be worth considering whether some reports could shift to a biannual or even longer cycle of publication."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,7,0,That's reports.

k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,8,0,"Colleagues, on funding, the graphic before you shows that the UN system's work relies on very heavily on voluntary contributions."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,8,1,"Roughly 80% of our total resources are from voluntary contributions, and therefore only 20 are derived from assessed funding of any kind."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,8,2,This also shows that the UN Secretariat accounts for only a relatively small share of overall system resources.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,8,3,"Most UN system funding, and therefore most delivery, takes place outside the Secretariat across funds, programs and specialized agencies."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,8,4,"And this level of voluntary funding dependence means that the way that voluntary funding is provided its predictability, its flexibility, or its earmarking has a major impact on how effectively we can deliver on the mandates that you hand to us."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,9,0,"The other dimension of this consideration concerns the size of the grant packages, the funding packages that we get."

k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,9,2,This funding comes in small packages.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,9,3,"A large share of our funding is delivered in these many small transactions, and each of these naturally carries with it its own administrative requirements."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,9,4,"And inevitably, the consequence is of a high administrative cost per individual grant compared with larger grants, consolidated contributions."

k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,1,0,And you've already heard extremely helpful replies from Guy Ryder and I will focus on on what Carolyn has just mentioned.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,1,1,"In particular, measures to improve impact and efficiency across the system."

k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,1,4,So there has to be consultation.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,2,0,"There have to be consultations, not just among ourselves states, but also with the relevant parts of the Secretariat, which honestly will help us to just understand what we are doing and what we are proposing."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,2,1,"And in particular, if we are proposing something that is perhaps already done or in part already done."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,2,2,"So we do believe that a consultation on substance, but also on procedure and on whether something is legally sound is extremely important to craft good mandates and to also have an understanding of what the implementation of a mandate will cost."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,2,3,"So we believe every resolution should be costed and that we should, before making a decision on how we express ourselves on a proposed new mandate, that we know the financial aspect of a decision."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,2,4,Linked to this is the question of reporting that you have also flagged.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,3,0,"Carolyn, as you know, I think the first question for us should be do we need a report?"
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,3,1,Because we do not believe that every resolution does need a report.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,3,2,The report can be extremely important and can be big value added.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,3,3,But that is not the case always.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,3,4,"And right now, I think mentally we are in a sort of space of automaticity."

k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,4,1,"So I think we need to rethink that and look at this, at this differently."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,4,2,"Then also think about, well, perhaps it's good to have a report at the beginning to frame a conversation and to give us a real basis to take a topic forward."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,4,3,"But maybe as we move ahead in the delivery of a mandate, and Guy has made it very clear in his comments how many reports are on regularly recurring topics and maybe the moment will come where the membership has sufficient information or is sufficiently served with being provided additional information and things that have changed."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,4,4,There are in fact reports that consist mainly of submissions by Member States.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,5,0,These reports tend to be extremely duplicative and repetitive.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,5,1,Sometimes they're very lengthy.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,5,2,"These are probably reports, we don't need it all anymore."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,5,3,"But again, it should be something that we look at as proponents of mandates, but also as those who are consulted and as part of the negotiations."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,5,4,The periodicity is also something that is best looked at at the very beginning if you propose a new mandate.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,6,0,"I think, again, this sort of reflex to say we do this every year because I think it's important is not necessarily, I mean, I don't think that is actually accurate."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,6,1,"I think it can have an extremely important mandate that is, that is discussed only three or five years."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,6,2,"And that is something we should think about when we, when we draft our mandates."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,6,3,"And this is linked also a little bit on impact, but also on the question, what are we doing here?"
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,6,4,"Is this forward looking, is this backward looking?"
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,7,0,"So certainly we would hope that we will have a much better toolbox for ourselves as we move ahead in our work, as we move forward, as we start crafting new mandates, as of course we will and as we have to, and that we implement the measures that are being discussed here, but that will also allow us to do it with already existing mandates because they typically come back."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,7,1,"So if we embrace a new way of doing this and if we embrace new best practices, of course that can then be applied also, also to mandates as they, as they come back and as we resubmit or renew them."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,7,2,So that is probably it for me.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",4,LIE,Liechtenstein,Christian Wenaweser,PR,,7,3,And thanks for having me.

k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",7,IAHWG,IAHWG,Carolyn Schwalger,Co-Chair,,0,3,"One of those questions relates to how can system wide coordination mechanisms such as the ceb, un, sdg, IASC be used to improve coherent mandate implementation?"
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",7,IAHWG,IAHWG,Carolyn Schwalger,Co-Chair,,0,4,And the other question is what drives so many entities to spread themselves so thin across so many mandates?
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",7,IAHWG,IAHWG,Carolyn Schwalger,Co-Chair,,1,0,And how can better coordination reduce competition for resources?
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",7,IAHWG,IAHWG,Carolyn Schwalger,Co-Chair,,1,1,And of course you're also welcome to share any brief reactions to other questions posed.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",7,IAHWG,IAHWG,Carolyn Schwalger,Co-Chair,,1,2,The floor is yours.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,0,0,Thank you very much.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,0,1,"In response to the first question, in terms of system wide coordination mechanisms, I mean, there is absolutely, I think, no debate whatsoever on the need for coordination mechanisms."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,0,2,"But I think where we need to investigate the time, the transactional costs that are incurred in these mechanisms is the key question."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,0,3,So coordination mechanisms absolutely necessary at the level of CEB and the UNSDG and iasc.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,0,4,"But I think when Guy was speaking, I, you know, noted that in the implementation he had written that, you know, we need to focus constantly on improving people's lives."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,1,0,"And you know, I can, I can sort of think of if we start each one of these meetings, numerous meetings and other mechanisms that we have in terms of saying, is the time spent, is the time that we're going to spend on this meeting."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,1,1,What is the direct correlation of the time spent in this meeting to actually making an impact and improving someone's lives?
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,1,2,"I think, you know, that kind of cross sectional analysis is very good in terms of, you know, how much time are we spending, to what effect and what are the actual results."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,1,3,"The second thing with respect to these coordination mechanisms and which I observed in the field, particularly when I was in the field in these coordination roles, is that what is discussed and agreed at headquarters doesn't necessarily find its way down to the field representatives."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,1,4,"So sometimes we have a situation where I think headquarters and the policy level feels quite, you know, satisfied that yes, we have made these kind of agreements and, you know, certain policies are in place."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,2,0,"But I think when you go down to the field level, sometimes at the field, the same kind of discussions which have already been agreed to at headquarters are taking place at the field level."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,2,1,"So there is that duplicative nature and that the decisions of headquarters not being transmitted in, I would have to say, in a rather forceful way to representatives on the ground to adhere to what has already been agreed."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,2,2,And so there is a lot of repetitiveness and there's a lot of time spent again at the field level.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,2,3,"The third in terms of coordination mechanism is also the host government's role that the UN does not do this coordination, whether it's at the CEB or the UNSDG or iasc in isolation it is working."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,2,4,It is in a host government.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,3,0,And likewise there has to be a parallel mechanism at the host country level that accepts this.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,3,1,So Guy made a very good example of Health and gavi.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,3,2,"But very often we would see that a ministry of, say, Maternal and Child Health doesn't necessarily, you know, adhere to something that has come from the planning ministry."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,3,3,"And so even at the host government level, there is sometimes a reluctance to come together, to assume a kind of coordination or a leadership maybe of one technical ministry."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,3,4,"So the UN in its coordination mechanisms has to have that translated at a host government, host nation level as well."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,4,0,And that also proves one of the challenges of this system wide coordination.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,4,1,"And the last point that I would make on this is that member states who are providing the funding are also, you know, I think, bear some responsibility in terms of this fragmentation."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,4,2,"And, you know, I was struck by, by the number of grants that are below $1 million, because whether a grant is $1 million or below $1 million or $20 million or more, you know, the same level of administrative and other things, you know, Ambassador Kimani talked about, maybe AI can, you know, can take some of these, but, you know, it still requires the same amount of work because the accountabilities that are set in for a project or a program that is below $1 million is the same accountability of something that is $20 million."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,4,3,"So there again is where the transactional costs of these kinds of coordination mechanisms I think, have just gone way beyond, as I said, if we measure, what do all these levels of reports, meetings, discussions and everything else translate actually into improving people's lives?"
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,4,4,So that is my few words on the system wide coordination.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,5,0,"As I said, it is absolutely necessary, but I think it can be streamlined."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,5,1,I think it can be more disciplined.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,5,2,"I think there can be more, you know, reaching out to both member states who are providing funding and to the host nations where we are working to also embrace and, you know, try and work within these mechanisms in their respective sides."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,5,3,"The second question was, what drives so many entities to spread themselves so thin across many mandates?"
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,5,4,And how can better coordination reduce competition for resources?
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,6,0,"And when I read that question, I said, you know, the answer is actually in the, in the question itself because all entities, all UN entities are competing for limited number, limited amount of resources."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,6,1,"And that is why sometimes if again, to take the example of the health sector, but, you know, it applies equally if someone is doing the implementation and the, you know, the procurement, for example, of vaccines and all the, you know, equipment and other things that are required for it."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,6,2,"But if the, you know, the sort of the supply chain in terms of a policy within the government is not there, it's very difficult for the procurement to happen in isolation."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,6,3,"And so what happens is there is a tendency then for someone who wants to make sure that the vaccines are implemented and that go right down to the deep field where all this is so essential, they automatically want to get involved also in the policy, in the funding."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,6,4,So it's very difficult.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,7,0,"Even though we may have specializations, it's very difficult to kind of separate that."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,7,1,"And the other thing that is so evident in the chart that was put up on the voluntary funding and the assessment funding is that, particularly when I was in the peacekeeping and peace operations, a lot of what came in the assist contributions should have been passed on to UN agencies who have the expertise and the experience and the knowledge of the country, you know, where they have been working for a long time."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,7,2,"And a lot could, could be done there."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,7,3,"It was, I think I mentioned that it was very, very difficult."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,7,4,"It is very difficult still to have that kind of passage between voluntary and assessed fundings again, you know, with, with having the chapeau of is this improving people's lives."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,8,0,But what happens is that we get into more thinking about silos and accountabilities and being able to deliver on something in order to be able to attract resources.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,8,1,"So again, here I feel there are responsibilities, and in this context, I would say more with member states who are providing the funding."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,8,2,"In the PC peacekeeping world that I was in, there was a total disconnect between those members of the foreign affairs ministries who were working to prepare the implementation and for example, the ministries of planning or development, and others who needed to look at early recovery."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,8,3,"So sometimes we had, in different parts of the UN almost at the same time, resolutions of funding decisions that were taking that were, that were not coordinated within that member state itself."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,8,4,"And I think that's where, you know, a lot of improvement in, within the coordination mechanisms and this ability to have each entity spread themselves so thin, thinking that, okay, if I have this in this program, it'll attract a little more money from this member state, because that's one of their country's priorities, too."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,9,0,"And so you kind of, you're fitting what you're going to do based on where you might align yourself with a member state's priorities, other than looking at, again, that central thing of improving people's lives where we are present."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,9,1,So I think it's difficult to see one element of a mandate in isolation and also the accountability sometimes become very difficult.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,9,2,And I think that's why so many entities are spreading themselves thin just in order to be able to capitalize on the very limited resources that are available for this particular issue.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",8,,,Amirah Haq,Former USG DFS,,9,3,So thank you very much.

k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",18,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,3,0,That does not mean that we are accelerating the implementation of a mandate or making a difference to improving people's lives in the field.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",18,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,3,1,So that's the first point that I wanted to make with regard to this larger point about periodicity.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",18,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,3,2,"Second, we need to make a distinction between an agenda item, a resolution or a draft decision, and reports of the UN Secretary General."

k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",18,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,3,4,"And a report of the Secretary General, even if there is a request for such a report, need not be done annually."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",18,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,4,0,So let me offer the example of the revitalization we have co chairs here present with us this morning.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",18,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,4,1,"We look at there's an agenda item on revitalization that is discussed annually, but the resolution is adopted biannually."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",18,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,4,2,"So it's entirely possible that an item is placed on the agenda, and that's the decision of the General Committee that looks at the list of the agenda item."
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",18,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,4,3,"An item is placed on the agenda possibly annually, but we don't need a resolution to be adopted annually."

k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",18,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,5,0,And we don't need a report of the SG on every agenda item on an annual basis.

k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",18,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,5,2,So I really think the data presented by the Secretariat Under Secretary General Guy Ryder about how we spend 10% of our budget on writing reports is not just financially not sustainable.
k1j/k1jax5ye21,Session 5,Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1,"Nov 14, 2025",18,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,5,3,It is simply not possible for any of us to read all the reports that we ourselves demand.

k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,2,2,"This is just to remind us that we're in a mandate life cycle approach, which goes from the."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,2,3,"The creation of mandates, how you adopt resolutions, the second stage of delivery, how the UN system implements mandates by turning them into activities to be undertaken across all pillars of the organization."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,2,4,That's the delivery phase.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,3,0,"And then what we're coming on to now, crucially, the third phase, in which member states come back to look at whether the work that the UN system has undertaken is indeed achieving the results intended and whether mandates remain relevant or whether they need to be adjusted."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,3,1,And I think one way of looking at this review phase of the cycle is to see it as a sort of a steering operation where member states have the opportunity to set the forward trajectory of the organization and its activities.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,3,2,"And if we're able to do that well, the entire mandate cycle can stay on course, moving us where we want to get to towards greater positive impact."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,3,3,"And alternatively, when it's not done so well, I think we can all see that there is a danger that the system can enter into a sort of drift, and we want to avoid that."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,3,4,"Now, as we see it, for a mandate review process to work optimally, two conditions reflected in the graphic before you would need to be met."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,4,0,"Firstly, Member States would need to have available to them a review process that allows them to steer strategically, not simply automatically to repeat discussions year after year as a sort of a. A default position."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,4,1,But that's only one half of the story.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,4,2,"The other half is that the UN system, our responsibility is to provide information that you need to assess the work that we have undertaken."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,4,3,"You need to have access to clear plans, clear results, and a presentation of the links between resource utilization and outcomes obtained."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,5,0,So we believe these two components would be integral to a successful review phase.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,5,1,"Now, perhaps I can go through each of these components in turn, beginning with the Member State review process."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,6,0,"Now, the question we might ask is what are the means at the disposal of Member States to provide the type of steer that the organization requires?"
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,6,1,"Obviously, the resolutions that you adopt are the most important and obvious instrument at your disposal."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,6,2,"But there is more than that because you shape the organization's direction also by deciding what goes on the agenda, how often issues come back for discussion, the kinds of reports that you want and how frequently you want them."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,6,3,And then all of this comes on top of the resolutions that you ultimately adopt.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,6,4,All of this indicates that you Member States are in the pilot seat throughout this entire process.

k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,7,1,"Now, in the mandates report, we identified initially the issue of frequently recurring business with limited changes to mandates."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,7,2,That's in quotes.

k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,7,4,"And some of the statistics that we presented in the report, I think are quite suggestive."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,8,0,"In 2024, the General assembly discussed about 370 agenda items and sub items."

k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,8,3,"Thirty percent of the issues discussed have been considered since 1990, and 55% of recurring resolutions have been very similar to the ones adopted in previous years, meaning at least 80% of the text is identical, the same word for word."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,8,4,"And these numbers, as I've said, are suggestive that in certain aspects, the steering process that I'VE talked to might simply be operating by autopilot now."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",2,UN Secretariat,UN Secretariat,Guy Ryder,USG Policy,,9,0,"Currently, as I've indicated, many agenda items come back year after year and there may be reason for that."

k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,0,2,"UNEP, the United Nations Environment Program, was founded in 1972 in the Stockholm Conference and it really is the place whereby mandate we're supposed to promote international cooperation on the environment, keep the environment under review, which essentially is science, and serve as a focal point for environmental action within the UN system."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,0,3,"And so being that pillar of the environment, we are enriched when other agencies take on the environmental issue but but address it through their mandate lens, be it human rights, be it children, be it health, et cetera."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,0,4,"So what some would call decentralization of the environmental mandate to the country, we call it a great strengthening and we need to think about this like you do in the context of your ministries of environment, where of course, whether it's roads or transport or urban or health environment features just as much so for UNEP itself."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,1,0,"Over the years since 1972 we have seen Member States through the UNEP processes give birth to a large number of conventions and two of these, you will know well, are not managed by UNEP or not hosted by UNEP."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,1,1,That will be climate change and desertification.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,1,2,But 17 others are indeed hosted by UNEP.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,1,3,"And of course, therefore but of course answerable to the party driven governance process of the COP structure, which you will know very well in 2022 and again in 2024 at the United Nations Environment assembly, discussions were held."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,1,4,"How can we ensure that the Environmental assembly, the United Nations Environmental assembly, creates a greater degree of synergy without interfering in the sovereign nature, if I can say so, of the multilateral environmental agreements and their cops?"
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,2,0,"And so at this point now in the unea, the United Nations Environment assembly, each assembly has an MEA day, an MEA Week, mea, Multilateral Environment Agreement."

k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,2,3,"When we have unea, which the whole week will focus on MEA dialogue precisely to enable a greater synergistic conversation, so to say, then how do we work and how do we maximize the impact of the mandates that are given to us by Member States through the United Nations Environment Assembly?"
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,2,4,"Well, Member States are about to, in December, at the upcoming UNEA Environment assembly, approve the next four year medium term strategy and the two year program of work."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,3,0,"This will be decided of course at the conference, but at the Assembly."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,3,1,But essentially it will deal with the three elements that UNEPT works on.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,3,2,"If I can summarize very much, climate stability, nature, biodiversity and land and pollution."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,3,3,"And what we then do is we construct a one impact framework that ensures that the whole of UNEP approach, where the different programs and projects that are funded by a variety of sources which are delivering obviously the mandate are then reported on and leads to an organizationally agreed by Member States vision under the medium term strategy."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,3,4,"So the impact framework also rides on a very, very strong measurement framework which shows how the work that we are doing here at UNEP is aligned with the International Agreed Goals, I.e."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,4,0,"the goals in the Climate Convention, in the Chemical Conventions, in the Biodiversity Convention, et cetera."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,4,1,And so that allows for that.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,4,2,"Even though these multilateral environmental agreements and their COPS take their decisions outside of the UNEA structure, nevertheless, a program that we see Member States approve is underpinning the very commitments that Member States have made in the COP structure."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,4,3,"So therefore, we have an integrated theory of change that link the mandates to measurable outcomes and that ensures that we translate those mandates that have derived from UNEA or indeed from the cops into quantifiable impact and not just sort of activities."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,4,4,"And the targets for these are set on the basis of implementation capacity and budgets, obviously."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,5,0,"And so when it comes to resource mobilization, because we only receive around 3% of our monies from the regular budget and the rest we mobilize."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,5,1,And so we seek to do this based on an allocation of all resources.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,5,2,We have a strategic planning process that is linked with program budgeting.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,5,3,Our total program in a two year period is just under 3 billion.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,5,4,The vast amount of this obviously being programmatic.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,6,0,"And we mobilize as if regular budget, but voluntary indicative scale of contribution just usually is around 19 million or so per year."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,6,1,That helps to pay for the spine of the organization.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,6,2,"So when we seek to then report to Member States, we seek to show progress against agreed indicators which are publicly available."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,6,3,"I should say to ensure that UNEP can be transparent and very much seen that here's what the science says, here's what Member States decided, here's what UNEP is doing."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,6,4,"That model demonstrates very much how the results based evidence informs, performs the mandate review and connects the mandates to the results, to the learning, etc."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,7,0,We do regular program performance reports to Member States.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,7,1,We do that on a quarterly basis.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,7,2,And so there's also a learning dimension obviously in that.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,7,3,"So through all of this with a mandate, we take very much, if I can say so, a life cycle approach to the mandate that is given to us, that are given to us by Member States, the strategic guidance, the development, support and implementation."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,7,4,"Now, since we are supposed to keep the environment under the review and therefore do the science, if I can say so, and you will recall that IPCC was created by a UNEP Governing Council resolution, you will recall that ipbs, a Biodiversity and Land Science Policy Panel, was created by a UNEP Governing Council resolution."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,8,0,"And just recently the Intergovernmental Science Policy Panel on Chemicals, Waste and Pollution Created by UNEA resolution."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,8,1,That science plus what UNEP Secretariat does itself allows us to do some degree of horizon watching to therefore the Executive Director about nine months or so before the United Nations Environment assembly issue a report to Member States saying these are the areas that are sort of horizon issues where you may wish to.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,8,2,"Well, recognizing that resolutions are a totally sovereign issue pertaining to Member States and prerogative."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,8,3,"Nevertheless, as we are supposed to review the science, we say here are areas that are coming up that are urgent or important or under attended to."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,8,4,Member States may then decide or not to take inspiration from the Executive Director's report to submit resolutions in that space.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,9,0,"Once resolutions begin to be submitted, we submit a what we call a technical note on each resolution."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,9,1,This is a technical note that deals with five issues.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,9,2,"How is that particular resolution aligned with the existing mandate and a strategy that you are about to approve at the same assembly, what is the relationship to existing mandates either within UNEP or in other fora that is is it duplicative?"
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,9,3,"In which case we would suggest it's duplicative and therefore you may wish to rethink Third, a legal assessment on the substance and procedural matters."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,9,4,"Fourth, the impact of the proposed draft."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,10,0,How would we measure whether we have done the thing that is being proposed?
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,10,1,"And fifth, how much is it going to cost?"
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,10,2,And so this we make available this Technical Note to Member States well ahead of the United Nations Environment assembly to allow Member States to use this as they would see fit for their consideration and deliberations.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,10,3,"We also allow us assign a technical, technically, scientifically and technical qualified focal point to be available to Member States in each of the resolution discussion meetings and of course we provide oral briefing briefings to Member States on the technical notes to ensure that some of the finer technical and scientific issues are highlighted."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,10,4,"Now, once a resolution has been adopted, we then support Member States through the implementation tracking portal and reporting portal."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,11,0,"We have established a resolutions portal that is publicly accessible and that monitors and reports on how we're doing on resolution A, B or C. It tracks and outlines the implementation plans for each resolution."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,11,1,"It provides milestones, the results, the availability of resources, the learning, the opportunity and the challenges, the risks and the lessons learned, the partners and so on and so forth."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,11,2,"And because we see of course Member States circulate in and out in terms of our permanent representatives, so we do familiarization sessions with permanent missions with this tracker so that they themselves, when new PRs come in, can follow this through."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,11,3,"And when we have completed a task, and an obvious one would be that we were asked two years ago to help establish the Science Policy Panel on Chemicals, Waste and Pollution and in July of this year this got gaveled and so we therefore have this panel."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,11,4,"So now that resolution can be retired, but when a resolution has been completed, then the monitoring and reporting portal for resolutions will provide a detailed report on the completion of that particular resolution."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,12,0,"Now you asked me my final point to reflect on the SG's report on the proposed solutions to improve the mandate review and we support all of the above and then some we think that there's a lot that could be done to follow quicker through, to monitor better, maybe particularly in two areas, to systematize and to reinforce the efforts that are underway to strengthen the mandate review mechanisms and to ensure that these efforts are in place across the various mandating bodies and also to include inspiring clauses as we just heard from USG Guy Ryder in the resolutions having more explicit mention of what is the results, when is it achieved and what is the lifespan, so that these resolutions are not carried into the forever, or at least we could have objective conditionalities under which something is continued or not, so sort of on, off switch."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,12,1,"Additionally, for the environmental pillar, of course, Member States may want to consider how they could delineate better what belongs in the assembly that the General assembly has established, the United Nations Environment assembly, which has the technical skills, the Scientific Secretariat and the environmental mandate related to the United nations and what they may choose to put at unga."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",6,UNEP,UNEP,Inger Andersen,Executive Director,,12,2,"So for us, we very, very much look forward to continuing working on and support the outcome of this working group and to contribute to enhancing the mandate life cycle at this very crucial time for the environment."

k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",9,OHCHR,OHCHR,Ilse Brands Karris,ASG Human Rights,,0,0,"So obviously this is the focus here, following on previous discussions you've had is the mandate review."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",9,OHCHR,OHCHR,Ilse Brands Karris,ASG Human Rights,,0,1,But clearly it relates to impact and prioritization as well as cost effectiveness.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",9,OHCHR,OHCHR,Ilse Brands Karris,ASG Human Rights,,0,2,"So obviously it links very well into the creation and implementation and efficiency effectiveness strand, as well as the structural programs, of course, also have very, very clear links where human rights is part of it."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",9,OHCHR,OHCHR,Ilse Brands Karris,ASG Human Rights,,0,3,"A second point is that the Human rights pillar which we here are talking about, it is of course the office of the High Commissioner as the UN entity, as the secretariat, but the ecosystem, importantly is the Human Rights Council with its universal periodic review, the investigative mechanisms, the special procedures, the mechanisms belonging there, but also the treaty bodies."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",9,OHCHR,OHCHR,Ilse Brands Karris,ASG Human Rights,,0,4,"So we do have we're talking about both Human Rights Council mandates and GA mandates, including the one that actually established the High Commissioner's mandate itself, the broad one, and to more limited extent, ECOSOC as well, ohchr, you may have noticed, has the largest amount number of mandates cited, 877."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",9,OHCHR,OHCHR,Ilse Brands Karris,ASG Human Rights,,1,0,But it should be taken into account that they're very varied.

k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,0,4,But let me start perhaps with a question relating to cost.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,1,0,"When we establish a mandate, there's clearly a cost dimension in terms of a PBI being required."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,1,1,But when we renew a mandate.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,1,2,"Or. Put it in a default mode where it goes through every year, is there a way of quantifying the cost of not doing a review or not retiring a mandate?"
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,2,0,"So my point is that there is a cost for action, but is there a way of quantifying the cost for inaction in terms of mandate review and renewal?"
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,2,1,"I think it's important to make this information available at some point so that delegations who are sovereign indeed, as was pointed out by several of the briefers, will have the relevant information to make decisions in an intergovernmental context."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,2,2,"Second point, also a question."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,2,3,"Is there a way the Secretariat can share actually how many mandates have actually been retired over the last 80 years and in what areas of the three pillars, have these retired mandates taken place?"
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,2,4,"I mean, obviously the Security Council has a very structured process and it's a much smaller body."

k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,3,2,"The General assembly, because these larger struggles with creating a structured process."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,3,3,"But I think it will be good to see how many mandates have been retired over the last 80 years, in which principal organs and under which pillars."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,4,0,"And a related question, how many retired mandates have come back on the agenda or to a new mandate?"
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,4,1,"The reason I ask that question is that it's important to have a permeable system where mandates can be created and retired with fluidity, because right now a lot of delegations would be very concerned about retiring a mandate, because that may be the death of a certain issue."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,4,2,But we want to create a more fluid situation that mandates can be renewed or retired.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,4,3,"It could come back very quickly if needed, so that we assure delegations that retiring mandate is not the end of an issue, but it could be a phase or it could be a pause."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,4,4,That's the second comment and question.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,5,0,My third question relates to consolidated reviews.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,5,1,I think USGuy Rider was talking about how consolidated reviews the exception rather than the norm.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,6,0,And could the Secretariat suggest a clustering of agenda items that could potentially be reviewed in a consolidated way in the future and present this to the consideration of Member States?
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,6,1,We can then look at it.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,6,2,"Either disagree with the Secretariat clustering, but I think the idea of a consolidated review of clusters of items with a view to just starting the review process, I think it's an important one."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,6,3,My last comment and question.
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,6,4,"I'm sorry, I think it was the presentations which have generated a lot of questions in my mind, relates to mandates which are minimally active."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,7,0,"Obviously, a lot of mandates are being renewed for a variety of reasons."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,7,1,"Politically, there is a need, there's a sense of urgency around certain issues, and some issues are just intractable, they need a longer time."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,7,2,"But if the level of activity is so minimal as to create an implementation deficit, to quote the words of the Assistant Secretary General here on the podium, then the question arises for Member States if the implementation deficit, because the activity is so minimal, Member States are confronted with the question, either we provide additional resources or we retire the mandate, or we put in a serious way of reviewing how we do something."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,7,3,"Again, that decision has to be made by Member States."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",16,SGP,Singapore,,PR,,7,4,"So my question to the Secretariat is whether the Secretariat will be able to identify a list of mandates that in its view, in the Secretariat's view, faces a minimal level of activity and therefore suggests that there is considerable implementation deficit and therefore requires the review of members to take a decision either to provide additional resources or to restructure the way the mandates are designed or to retire the mandate."
k1q/k1q2ukeao9,Session 7,Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group,"Nov 25, 2025",17,SGP,Singapore,,Representative,,0,0,So these are some questions and comments.
