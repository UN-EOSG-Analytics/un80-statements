# Session 2 | Mandate Creation briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group (Oct 13, 2025) 

**IAHWG | Carolyn Schwalger | Co-Chair**

Good morning, everybody.
I call to order the informal meeting of the Working Group to hear a technical briefing on mandate creation.
On behalf of Ambassador Wallace, I warmly welcome all of you to this technical briefing.
We recognize the presence of Ms. Ayaka Suzuki, Director in the Executive Office of the secretary general, and Mr. Christophe Monnier, director of the Program Planning and Budget Division in the Department of Management, Strategy, Policy and Compliance, as well as Her Excellency Ms. Maritza Tan, Permanent Representative of Costa Rica, and Ms. Min Thu Pham, Founder and CEO of Project Starling.
Colleagues, we have an important task ahead of us.
The UN is at a critical juncture.
The UN 80 initiative provides a unique opportunity to build a UN that is more effective, efficient, accountable and capable of responding to contemporary needs.
This informal ad hoc working group provides the mechanism for us as Member States, to be constructively engaged in the effort to strengthen the ability of this organisation to deliver concrete outcomes for the people of the planet as envisaged in the Charter.
We encourage Member States to seize this opportunity as the first intergovernmental process launched under the UN80 initiative.
The this informal ad hoc working group has a particular responsibility to build trust and mutual understanding and to demonstrate that concrete progress can be made on reforms that can strengthen this organisation and improve the effectiveness, efficiency and impact of its work, as outlined in our letter.
On the 7th of October we will begin our work with a Discovery phase.
This will include consultations among Working Group members and, subject to the interest of Working Group members, research and analysis to ensure our consultations are informed by empirical evidence and data.
Today's briefing marks the start of this Discovery phase and will run until mid December.
It is the first of three shorts executive level briefings, each of which will focus on one of the three stages of the mandate life cycle creation, implementation and review.
The briefings will provide an opportunity for senior leaders to consider the recommendations under each section of the Secretary General's report on the Mandate Implementation Review, which was published on 31 July in more detail.
The briefing also provides you with an opportunity to consider other ideas and perspectives and to ask questions.
Each technical briefing will then be followed by consultations on the same topic about a week later.
At the consultation, Working Group members will have the opportunity to hear responses to the questions posed at the briefing sessions, convey their views on the recommendations provided in the Secretary General's report or by the briefers, and importantly, put forward their own ideas and proposals for consideration.
Today's briefing will focus on the topic of mandate creation.
We have invited four briefers to speak on this topic, each has been selected for their depth of knowledge and insights on mandate creation, with each offering different perspectives for our consideration.
Like all of us here today, they are invested in the effective functioning of the un.
Following their presentations, there will be an opportunity for Working Group members to ask questions of our briefers.
As noted in our letters of 7 and the 10October, we remind colleagues that today's session is focused on providing Working Group members with information.
We welcome members wishing to deliver statements outlining their perspectives and proposals on mandate creation, to do so at the consultations scheduled for 23rd of October.
And I now give the floor to my Co Chair, Ambassador Wallace.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Thank you so much, Co Chair.
And we will move immediately into the work for today.
I will therefore give the floor to Mr. Ayaka Suzuki, Director in the Executive Office of the Secretary General, to brief the Working Group on current practice exercised in the creation of mandates and to provide an elaboration on the recommendations contained in the Secretary General's report on mandate creation.
I also invite her to update the Working Group on progress in taking forward the recommendations in the report that lie within the Secretary General's existing authority as Chief Administrative Officer and what further support the Secretariat may be able to provide to Member States when creating mandates, including access to data and analysis.
Mr. Zukey, I give you the floor.

**UN Secretariat | Ayaka Suzuki | Director, EOSG**

Thank you very much, madam.
Co chair.
Mr. Co chair, good afternoon, or good morning rather.
Excellency and Distinguished Delegates, thank you so much to the Co Chairs for inviting us to deliver a briefing today.
It's a great pleasure to be here.
So today we will walk through key insights and suggestions from the Mandate Implementation Review Report which was issued on 31st of July.
And the focus today, as mentioned by the Co Chairs, is the creation phase, where mandates are made and how better visibility, design and stronger collaboration and enhanced support could improve delivery of mandates with a bigger impact.
With this presentation, my team and I hope to contribute to a shared understanding of this process.
So first, let us just recall from the report that every mandate has a life cycle.
If you could advance to the next slide, that would be great.
So creation, delivery and review, ideally connected via feedback.
When mandate creation is clear and coordinated, delivery improves and review produces learning that in turn improves the next iteration of the mandate.
Based on the insight in the report, our goal is structure, strengthening our support to you in that first step so that the whole system can perform better.
So before I dive in, let me answer a simple question.
How would one define a mandate in simple terms?
And for the purpose of the report, we're treating a mandate as a request or directive for action written in the operative paragraphs of of a resolution or decision adopted by mandating organs such as the General Assembly.
It is the instruction that tells the United nations or other implementing entities that Member States have asked it to do.
This slide shows how a resolution might translate into mandates and results so for example, in resolution General assembly resolution on the pattern of conferences, which was adopted in December 2023, which is the mandate source, contains a request to the Secretary General to produce a report on conferences.
This report needs to be planned and budgeted in the program budget.
Post and non post.
Resources need to be approved so that the requested report can be prepared.
Ideally, the report is delivered on time and has data to support your review of our performance and informed decisions on how to improve is a simple chain Decisions, Mandates, Actions and results for Mandate creation the report identifies limited visibility as a key challenge which is the situation today across the UN system.
Mandates originate from many bodies, not just the main organs of the United nations, but also mandating organs of specialized agencies or related organizations.
Since 1946, more than 40,000 resolutions have been adopted in the General Assembly, Security Council, ecosoc and Human Rights Council alone.
However, most bodies lack straightforward and up to date registries, let alone a registry that looks across all of these bodies.
That increases the risk of unintended duplication and overlap.
The review therefore recommends building comprehensive registries and strengthening coordination among secretariats that are supporting these governing bodies.
In short, visibility matters because it is hard to manage better what is hard to see.
So to start closing that visibility gap, we have launched mandates.un.org which was launched, as you may recall, in conjunction with the release of the Mandate Implementation Review Report.
This site compiles the source documents the UN entities cite when explaining why their programs exist and why they need resources.
You can search by entity, mandating organ or subject, and quickly see links between mandate sources and proposed programs.
It is interactive and we encourage everyone who have not tried this to explore it.
New features are also regularly added.
I personally find this to be a very exciting new tool.
Here is a concrete example to see what you might find when you use this tool.
Youth.
You can see how the same subject of Youth appears in 48 resolutions or decisions across eight different bodies the General Assembly, ECOSOC, Security Council, Human Rights Council, and so on.
Some 30 UN entities cited these sources 128 times in support of programs proposed for 2026.
Sometimes it's helpful, sometimes it may be duplicative and may include extra reporting.
Using this tool, mandates un.org we can immediately trace potential overlaps and their sources.
As I said, everything's interactive and you could click and it links you to necessary documents later.
Ambassador Schwalger, we talked about disability.
We have an example of that as well, and we can take a look at that.
So visibility is only the first part.
The design of mandate shapes how well they can be delivered.
And here three challenges stand out.
Longer text resolutions are getting lengthier and more complex.
More prescriptive wording, which leads to less flexibility for implementation and tasking within existing resources without reducing previously mandated tasks, is becoming more frequent.
And it's now appearing more often than even budget is, even as budgets decline.
So the report proposes four potential remedies.
First, better secretariat support during drafting.
Second, AI tools that can help flag potential duplications or complementarities.
Third, mandates framed so that the Secretary General can allocate the task to those with the best comparative advantages.
And fourth, avoiding new tasks without corresponding resources or reduction in tasks.
The message here is clarity, flexibility and practicality.
These are what make mandates deliverable.
Now, creating better mandates is a shared responsibility.
In simple terms, it takes people, guidance and tools that we have summarized on this slide.
People capacity, the Technical Secretariat, subject matter experts and training or tools to support efficient drafting, guidance and frameworks to help negotiators craft better processes and language on mandated activities, entities and resource implications.
Data and AI tools, registries and drafting modules that flag overlap before it happens.
Together, we believe these elements can form the basis of renewed collaboration between all of us.
So let me end with three key takeaways.
First.
First, visibility matters.
More accessible information prevents duplication and improves coordination.
Second, design drives delivery more concise, clear, properly resourced mandates achieve real impact.
Third, enhanced support, stronger people guidance technology and support to assist your work.
Our next briefing in the next iteration of this series will go deeper into delivery and resources resourcing.
But for today, our core message is simple.
And again, this is for the creation phase of the mandate life cycle.
Visibility leads to better design leads to stronger delivery equals greater impact.
Thank you and I look forward to your questions and reflections.
And thank you for giving me the opportunity.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Co Chairs thank you so much, Ms. Suzuki, and to your team for preparing such an interesting and informative presentation.
I now give the floor to Mr. Christophe Monnier, Director of the Program Planning and Budget Division in the Department of Management, Strategy, Planning, Policy and Compliance, to brief the Working Group on the relationship between mandate creation and the UN budget process, including how it currently works and how it might be improved.

**UN Secretariat | Christophe Monnier | Director, PPBD (DMSPC)**

Christoph thank you, Ambassador Wallace.
And thanks to Ambassador Schrager and Ambassador Wallace, the co Chair of the Working Group, for having us today and giving us this opportunity of the briefing on the I'll pass a few moments to explain a few concepts and then discuss a bit more on the budget part.
So on the Legislative framework, the purpose of this slide is to explain how we define a mandate in a budget context and link it to the budget process.
So legislative mandate as indicated by my colleague Ayaka is a request for action that is addressed to the Secretary General on Executive Head, acting on his behalf in a resolution or decision adopted by a competent United nations intergovernmental organ.
And this is governed by the policy document we call PPBME that has a very long name you see on this slide.
The budget themselves are also driven by such requests for action and the Rule 153 of the Rules of Procedure of the General assembly provides two checkpoints to ensure that Member States are fully aware of the resulting resource requirements, one before a resolution is recommended for approval by a Committee and a second checkpoint before approval by the General assembly following a review by the ACABQ and the Fifth Committee.
Now how are budget derived from resolution and decisions?
The resolutions or decisions I'll be speaking only about resolution for simplification, but I always mean both are what drives the results based budget containing the program plan and the resource proposals.
In a resolution we typically have two aspects the preambler paragraphs which express the background, sentiment and concern of Member States and the operative paragraph that provide guidance and mandates for the Secretariat or other stakeholders.
The concerns expressed in the preambler paragraph help the Secretariat to formulate a long term objective which reflects the desire and State to address the needs of Member States and the operative paragraphs contain the mandates for the Secretariat to determine the deliverable and output which the Secretariat is expected to produce in order to contribute to the collective achievement of the objective.
The strategy is what links the both and is the plan approach to produce the mandated deliverable to meet the needs of Member States and most effectively contribute to the long term objective.
On the left side you see the performance measures that are there to demonstrate the progress made, while on the right hand side the inputs on the purple box are the budgetary resources that are required to fund the activities undertaken by the Secretariat to produce the mandated deliverables.
So we now focus on those budgetary resources.
You've heard us talk about program budget implications.
Those are linked to a resolution that indicates that resource that has implications resource implication so a pbi, how we call it is prepared in response to a draft resolution with mandate to the Secretariat to conduct new or expanded activities.
It is communicated to Member States prior to the adoption of of a draft resolution and is then later issued as a supplementary budget to request additional resources to implement mandates not included in the current approved budget or proposed budget.
After that, it's considered by the ACABQ and then the Fifth Committee before being approved through a formal decision of the General Assembly.
Alongside approval of the resolution, we have a different format for PBIS called Oral Statement.
Those are used instead of a PBI when we have three situations.
Either the resource implications are not yet known and are pending future decision by Member States, for example, if the format and location of a new meeting or conference is still to be defined if the frequency or size of a new report is also to be defined.
The second case is when the resource implications are known but will be communicated in a subsequent revised estimate, possibly grouping several program budget implications.
This is how, for example, we proceed with PBIS resulting from ECOSOC decisions or from the Human Rights Council.
The third situation is when resource implication relates to a future proposed program budget not yet issued by the Secretary General.
The resource implication will be proposed in the relevant future proposed program budget, for example, if anything is done today with an impact on 2027 or later, because those are not yet proposed program budget.
Now if we look at the budgetary implications are clearly directly influenced by nuances in the language used in the resolution.
Without fully getting into the details of this slide, I wanted to mention how the language of the operative paragraph of a resolution drives the understanding by the Secretariat of the intent of Member States to be interpreted as having potential budgetary implications.
The resolution must contain a binding request for action and require new or expanded activities.
In the interest of time, I will not develop further at this stage, but I would like to highlight the need to ensure the mandate creation process makes the intent of Member States very clear.
To warrant the implementation by the Secretariat or the UN system corresponds to the expectations on the aspect of costing resolutions.
I'd like to mention that upon reviewing a draft resolution, the Secretariat conducts an internal review to determine the workload related to the required activities and whether these activities can be absorbed within existing resources or what additional resources will be required.
The tool presented by my colleague Ayaka would be instrumental in helping both Member States and the Secretariat identifying connections, synergies or potential duplication with existing deliverables and activities.
Technically, the use of the expression within existing resource in the draft resolution of the Main Committee does not preclude budgetary implication if the Secretariat assesses that the delivery of those additional mandated activity cannot be absorbed within existing resources.
I know that the use of the expression has become more frequent over the years and is quite unpopular amongst my colleagues.
I feel, however, that it could be a good indicator of the true intent of Member State within existing resources signals to the Secretariat that Member States expect the additional activities to be of a relatively low impact and to be absorbed within existing resources, accepting de facto that those existing resources originally given for other mandated activity will now be shared for those additional mandated activity, possibly leading to a lessening of some other activities.
The absence of this expression within existing resource signaled to the Secretariat that that Member States are ready to consider providing additional resources for those new mandated activities as assessed under the strict principle governing in particular the revised estimates relating to the proposed program budget for 2026 with an expectation of delivery under an efficient framework, making full use of possible synergies and avoiding duplications and this will be my last slide in terms of support to Member States in linking the mandate creation and the budgetary resources.
We have in place briefings to the main Committees on the PBI process and we are open to provide them more frequently or to larger audience and to enrich them to better meet the requirements of Member States and are very interested in your feedback on those in terms of support on the drafting.
While we are actively supporting the process today, improvements could be made to be more present throughout the maturation of the resolution, but this would require additional focus resources.
In addition, it's also noted that during conferences the same drafting consultation with PPBD does not usually take place and this is a weak point that might require further discussions on improving the review and presentation of program plans.
We review the mandates and deliverables annually to identify those no longer required to be referenced and and potential streamlining of activities to ensure effective use of resources in the implementation of mandates.
The outcome of this Working Group and proposal Under Work Stream 3 would provide opportunities for further strengthening program plans.
The revised estimate report on the program budget and support account that I mentioned earlier reflects some of these areas where program managers have identified areas where they can increase the use of existing mechanism to identify opportunities to consolidate and streamline work, including recommendations to change the frequency, format or terminate specific outputs and deliverable.
Mr. Chair, thank you very much.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank Mr. Monnier for that interesting presentation.
I now invite Her Excellency Maritza Chan, Permanent Representative of Costa Rica, to provide insights from the perspective of of a Member State who has been involved in the creation of mandates in a number of different capacities.
Ambassador Chan, the floor is yours.

**Costa Rica | Maritza Chan | Permanent Representative**

Thank you, Ambassador, Excellency, Colleagues, I wish to thank Ambassador Schwager and Wallace for inviting me to share our views.
We're certain that with your leadership this will be a successful process.
Mandates are truly at the heart of of everything the United nations does.
Each mandate reflects an agreement among Member States on how to address an issue and what action needs to be taken.
Yet the current context compels us to be more deliberate in how we create mandates.
I will share key observations from Costa Rica's experience in either chairing, co facilitating or presiding over different intergovernmental processes.
I will highlight persistent experiences which reveal both affected approaches and persistent challenges.
A positive example comes from the 2024 conference to review progress in the implementation of the Program of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate Illicit Trade in Small Arms Allied Weapons in all its aspects.
RepCom4 in response to the new technological developments such as polymer and modular weapons and 3D printing, Member States agree to establish an Open Endeavor Technical Expert Group.
This mandate was needs driven.
It emerged from real challenges, focus narrowly on actionable outcomes and build on previous commitments while adapting to new context.
The Small Arms and Light Weapons Fellowship Program exemplifies a mandate designed for direct impact.
When a mandate is clearly justified, appropriately scope and linked to current realities, it strengthens the UN capacity to respond.
A second experience I'd like to share is the 2024 negotiation of the Modalities Resolution for the High Level Meeting on addressing the existential threats posed by sea level rise.
The General assembly decided to convene a high level meeting within existing resources, but later on it became evident that those existing resources would not be enough.
Additional throughout the negotiation process, delegations recognized that the meeting alone would not suffice for the UN to properly start to address this issue.
So three additional mandates were created a Secretary General's report with inputs from Member states, a political declaration, and the High Level Meeting itself.
This case highlights two points.
First, new thematic areas often require new mandates to build institutional attention from the ground up.
Secondly, early coordination with DGACM was essential to anticipate budgetary implications and whether mandates can be realistically implemented and properly resourced.
When chairing the first committee in 2024, we observed a third example with both potential and pitfalls.
During the 29th session, the committee adopted 77 draft resolutions and decisions.
However, only 27 were adopted without a vote.
The remaining 50 required recorded votes with 156 separate specific paragraphs votes requested, leading to 201 total votes compared to 148 the previous year.
Of course, not all resolutions create mandates.
Mandates are created by resolutions or decisions with operative or actional elements.
Many resolutions have operative paragraphs that in fact do not invoke action, and frequently operative paragraphs which invoke action are unclear in their intent.
Sometimes this is the result of finely balanced negotiations, sometimes it is unintended.
Extracting mandates from resolutions and decisions can lead to the Secretariat and wider UN system which implements them to have to make subjective decisions about Member States intentions.
As we all know, many resolutions are long, repetitive and lacked sunset clauses or review clauses.
One off resolutions are by far the exception rather than the norm.
Many also include rollover annual requests for compilations of State views that carry production cost.
While the compilations themselves gather little interaction, bringing into question the value of the requests themselves, what at the same time show the difficulty for States to follow up on those requests?
This is a problem in several committees.
This combination of voting fragmentation, procedural inefficiency and no engagement outputs compel us to ask fundamental questions in a Committee such as the first committee when in 2024 only 27 out of 77 resolutions and decisions achieved consensus.
Should we pursue more resolutions annually or would fewer, better focused proposals on biennial or triennial cycles allow time for genuine consensus building?
Similarly, we must question whether to continue commissioning Secretary General's reports and annual compilations at the rate we have been doing so when resources are constrained and engagement remains minimal.
For instance, first committee mandates that consistently receive fewer than 10 replies could transition to less frequent reporting cycles, allowing the Secretariat to focus resources on higher quality, more impactful outcomes and provide states with more time to fulfill the requirements requirements.
Another example is my experience as Vice President of the ECOSOC Humanitarian affairs segment in 20242025 we received divergent views about the annual resolution, particularly its overlap with the General assembly omnibus Humanitarian Resolution.
Both segments traditionally produced negotiated outcome documents through repetitive annual discussions.
In 2025, Costa Rica took a different approach.
Instead of negotiating yet another formal outcome document, we issue a Call to Action.
This shorter, more strategic document, developed through streamlined consultation with Member States, sent a strong collective message of support to those affected by humanitarian emergencies and to the humanitarian system.
Instead, the result 151 states supported the call to action, a commitment beyond ECOSOC's membership.
How can we improve mandate creation?
Now turning to this question of improving mandate quality and discipline, I would like to make five points.
Firstly, mandates are more likely to be implemented and deliver quality outcomes for people and planet if they are created thoughtfully at the outset.
Secondly, there is a growing trend of resolution coming commissioning SG reports.
In my experience, the SG reports that actually get read and used are the ones with expert analysis.
We saw this with the new topics like AI, they sparked real debate because they offer insight, not just aggregation.
A shift from compilation to analysis in SG reports would be transformative.
Thirdly, before we create more mandates, we need to map what we already have.
When we spotted the duplication between ECOSOC and the General assembly humanitarian resolutions, we addressed it, but that was one case we happened to notice.
We need systemic visibility and thus I welcome this fund finding in the SG report on Monday.
Implementation Review Fourthly, some simple tests might help us understand whether a mandate we have created is of sufficient enduring interest to the collective membership.
Does a mandate with which commissions and SG report get more than 20 responses does a mandate which establishes an agenda item on the UN's books result in engagement from more than a dozen states?
Has the mandate produced something concrete in three years?
Are the costs reasonable for what the mandate produces?
And how would we know unless a monitoring and evaluation mechanism is built in?
If we can say yes to to these questions, should it trigger a review of the mandate?
Fifthly, I welcome the proposal in the ESRI report which suggests the Secretariat could do a better job of assisting Member States to create higher quality mandates.
I encourage the Secretariat to engage with Member States, including those who lead initiatives.
Observe as co facilitators or co chair for process on what this support could look like.
This is also a shared responsibility.
All co facilitators should seek that assistance from the start of each process.
Finally, I'd like to add one more thing.
Leadership makes a real difference in how mandates are created.
It matters who the PGA designates to run a negotiation, and it matters what experience those persons bring.
We've seen that skill facilitation can turn a contentious process into a productive one, and that preparation and institutional knowledge help Member States find common ground.
Getting the right people in these roles is how we create mandates which delivered meaningful outcomes.
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank Ambassador Chan for that interesting and thought provoking presentation.
I now invite Ms. Mintu Pam, co Founder and CEO of Project Starling, to provide insights and lessons learned from the last intergovernmental process to consider reform of mandates in 2006 in which she played a central role within the UN secretariat.

**Project Starling | Minh-Thu Pham | Founder & CEO**

Thank you so much.
Thank you Excellencies.
And thank you Ambassador, the Ambassadors from Jamaica and New Zealand for inviting me here to address you all.
Ladies and Gentlemen, distinguished guests, as Ambassador Wallace has just mentioned, I had the, the fortune, or maybe for some the misfortune of being designated within Kofi Annan's office actually 20 years ago now in October of 2005, to lead the Secretariat's mandate review to support the Member States mandate review.
And so my comments draw from that experience.
And I was heartened to hear that so many of you wanted to hear about what were some of the lessons from that time.
So let me get right to it.
The 2006-2007 mandate review, one of the core lessons from that is that a detailed backwards looking intergovernmental review of existing mandates was unmanageable.
The reason for that is because you don't have the information that you Member States need to do a full review of past and current mandates, including and especially budgetary information that would be required.
And third, success for this mandate review, you should carefully think about what are the criteria for success.
I was encouraged to see that the co facilitators have laid out a really constructive process, I think, for how you might consider the mandates and especially the process by which mandates are created, delivered and reviewed.
And that success should not be reviewed.
Success should not be determined based on how many mandates you get rid of.
As you heard from Ms. Suzuki earlier today, mandates can be everything from establishing an organization to just designating a report to be written.
And those are very, very different types of mandates.
So if you say we got rid of one mandate, that could have been the issuing of a report or an entire institution or agency or fund or program within the un.
Those are very different things.
So just consider how you consider success.
Mandates are carefully negotiated outcomes of extensive and often contentious intergovernmental negotiations.
You all know that very, very well.
Reviewing all existing mandates could mean that you are relitigating decades of difficult compromises.
The current governments that are in place now, the ones that you all lead, would be forced to rehash agreements that were made by their predecessors and that would reopen old wounds.
You are in a different political context right now.
And rehashing old mandates that may or may not still be relevant, I think would reopen those old wounds.
And I think you may find that you'll be relitigating 80 years of diplomacy.
I have to say the process that the co facilitators have taken to look forward is the way to help build goodwill and trust, which is needed at the beginning of an extensive reform process.
In 2006 and 2008, member states took a clerical approach to avoid reopening old wounds.
That was the right call at that time, given that the 2006 World Summit's directive, meaning the language that was in the World Summit outcome, was to, quote, review all mandates older than five years, originating from resolutions of the General assembly and other organs.
That meant that we did not have the option that you have in front of you now, which is to look forward at the mandate life cycle and what should be done to put in place the systems to make it better.
The reason why the past mandate review didn't work so well was because the directive was to review old mandates older than five years.
And back then, after two and a half years of tedious work to examine individual mandates for duplication and delivery, the process simply lost steam.
In fact, I left the Secretary General's office in the middle of 2007, about halfway through, because I also lost steam this time, I suggest that we look forward.
Just as the co facilitators have advised you.
You will always find more unity looking forward into the future than looking backwards into the past.
You should focus instead on the fundamental reason why we have a mandate problem, the mandate life cycle.
And it really is a cycle.
It's a feedback loop.
How mandates are created is really a byproduct of what happened before then and what exists currently within the system.
It's really encouraging to see that the Secretary General has addressed the systemic challenge in his report.
And that was something that we in 2006 in Kofi Annan's office also highlighted at the time.
We had to focus on old mandates because of the World Summit's mandate.
But I really do urge you to follow the lead this time, to look into the future.
If you take decisions to strengthen the way that we create and monitor mandates, you'll be better off, the UN will be better off, and you'll enable us also to potentially refresh our existing programs.
What do I mean by that?
Here's the core problem.
Member states create mandates to address transnational problems.
So there are challenges in the world that you see the UN playing a role to address.
And yet, too often, as the Secretary General's report indicates, you have to do this without full insight into what already exists across the UN system.
You don't know in fact what's working, what's potentially overlapping, and where right resources could be shifted or what programs could be updated to then respond to the challenge that you're having to address.
In the absence of that visibility, decisions rely on incomplete information or even your own national analyses rather than shared evidence that you all are working from the same set of information.
And as you all know not every member state can conduct their own national analyses.
As a result, this often results in fragmentation, which you all know is a major problem within the system where some parts of the UN are perceived as more effective than others.
This can also increase politicization in the intergovernmental decision making process where you're all relying on your own information or your own perceptions as to what needs to be done.
The Secretariat is capable of providing the assessments of implementation and that is essential for you to create new mandates.
However, that requires investment and I know that's not something we're talking about necessarily in an environment of budgetary austerity, but it really does require investment.
Around the world, well run organizations devote about 3 to 10% of their budgets to program evaluation.
You all know this within your own bureaucracies, the UN system, and this is my own calculation, and it was our calculation back in 2006 that the UN spends likely closer to about 1% or less than 1% of its budget on proper program evaluation.
You don't know what's happening if you don't have a sense of the assessment of how the programs are working.
And I'd encourage that perhaps the Secretariat or others can provide you with this specific number.
How much does the UN actually devote to proper program evaluation?
If we strengthen the UN's capacity to do internal, meaning self, evaluation, as well as external independent evaluation, meaning externally validated assessments of the UN's work that would provide you with evidence that can then inform your creation of mandates, Member States, you all have to be given the information so that you understand and can then discuss and adopt new mandates.
Essentially, it's so that you can be better custodians of your mandates.
This is essentially what Secretary General Kofi annan recommended in 2006 and what the current Secretary General has just suggested in his report.
In that 2006 assessment, we realized that we had to significantly invest in evaluation capacity across the system.
That includes oios, the Joint Inspections Unit, and then individual program based inside the departments and offices and agencies self evaluation so that you could then have better streamlined reporting and more transparent understanding of what is actually required budgetary wise when you ask for a new mandate and when the Budget Office is then giving you a program budget implication.
This is the essence of evidence.
Informed policymaking.
In the Secretary General's recent report under Mandate Creation, here's my recommendation.
He recommends that improving Secretariat support for Member States during mandate creation and that you need to complement budget estimates with information on related programmatic activities across the system.
I think that's absolutely necessary.
And I would urge you all to consider going one step further.
Build into every mandate budget a modest dedicated percentage for evaluation, so that from the outset, when a mandate is created as part of the cycle, you are building in implementation, learning and assessment as part of the design of mandates.
If we don't know, and we're not budgeting for the system to understand how well and whether your mandates were implemented, there's no way you would know what should be the next mandate that you create for those of you, Because I've suggested a forward looking approach for those of you who are concerned about reviewing existing mandates.
What do we do about the backlog of our existing mandates, the thousands that we've discussed, and to know whether they are duplicative or overlap or even remain relevant?
I'd suggest that the best solution is not to conduct another sweeping review, at least not yet, maybe a little bit later in your phases, but rather to make these changes, investing in understanding what the visibility across a system of the mandates are, and then whether or not the evaluation is there to know how well those mandates are being done.
If you do that, then you'll know whether or not the existing mandates are still relevant or even if they've been delivered well.
What you need is the information that tells you not only what activities took place, which is essentially what the content of many of the UN's reports are, but also you need to know, what difference did it make.
That information strengthens transparency, accountability, and ultimately public trust, which is in short supply these days, especially in institutions like this one.
And this can be reported back to you in a way that enables even the smallest of missions.
I know how strapped, because I work with so many of you, how strapped some of the smallest missions are.
You cannot read the thousands of reports that the UN issues every day, every day, every year.
So it's so important so that you can really understand and then credibly adopt new mandates.
So my appeal to you today is not about an issue that's going to make the headlines.
It's about the quiet systems that ultimately make multilateral cooperation work.
I've devoted my career to improving how the UN delivers because I know personally what a functioning UN can do.
My life is.
I'm here because of the un.
When I was three, after the war, my family fled Vietnam by boat.
We were rescued by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and brought to a refugee camp that UNHCR ran in Indonesia before being resettled.
My life is shaped by the UN's ability to work when it works well when it's adequately funded, when we invest in knowing how well it works, the UN can save lives and expands what's possible for millions.
Strengthening your ability to better adopt mandates with better evaluative information, with better visibility across the system, so that the UN can learn and adapt is one of the surest ways that it can continue to do so.
This was a huge lesson from 2006.
The poet Edna St Vincent Millais said, life is not one thing after another.
Life is not one thing after another.
It's one damn thing over and over again.
Her point was that life keeps repeating itself and the same problems keep coming up again and again.
I can't believe that I'm here 20 years later talking to you about something that is a scar.
I'm still recovering from the 2006 mandate review.
But by improving, you really have a great opportunity right now.
By improving the mandate life cycle, as has been proposed, and building into that the budget that is needed to do evaluation, by addressing these systemic issues, you can try to prevent the same mandate problems from coming up again and again.
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Thank you so much, Ms. Pham, for those insights and for that personal touch as well.
The impact of this organization is legendary.
It's our task to make sure that it remains so going forward.
In the time remaining, I'm going to now open the floor for any questions from delegations on the briefings we have just heard.
I'm just going to remind you, delegations, that this briefing will be followed in a week or 10 days by informal consultations at which there will be an opportunity for delegations to deliver prepared statements to ensure today that we can take as many questions as possible in the next half an hour.
We're asking that you keep your interventions short, no longer than a minute and a half or so.
With that, I give the floor to the distinguished representative of the European Union, to be followed by China.

**EU | Representative**

Thank you.
Co chairs supremely appreciate this opportunity today.
And the briefers very enlightening and full support for your work.
I have three very, very short questions.
The first one has to do with the discussion that was opened by Project Startling now about the existing mandates.
I do understand the experience of 2004, but back then, of course, all the tools that were described by the Secretary this morning, the AI tools in our disposal, the knowledge of every single mandate out there, the capacity to combine them and see all their overlaps, those didn't exist back there.
So one question is, could those tools, or how could those tools also help us if we were to, if they were to be applied to existing mandates and would you need more or different kinds of tools when you look at existing mandates as opposed to advising on new ones?
And to the cofax, A question on this and to everyone else really, can we envision a possibility for the Member States in the committee process itself to be able to work on the evaluation, assessment of mandates, implementation of them, making sure that the UN itself helps implement its own mandates in a conscious of potentially given that limited time, avoiding looking perhaps at some sessions, at the discussion of renewals of mandates, renegotiation of mandates, all those things and instead focus on implementing them.
Does that make sense?
Second question has to do with related to the first with tying adoption to implementation assessment.
Can you please tell us how many mandates today already have a sunset clause, if any do how many do have a built in monitoring, assessment, evaluation mechanism, implementation mechanism, how those are working?
Are they working well or are they not working well?
Now a third question has to do with badger allocation itself and to understand which mandates you know, have which badgered requirements.
I do not know if the best way is to ask do we have the top 50 most expensive mandates in the UN system?
And if we do, can we look at the details of those and understand what costs what and whether or not we could achieve better results in implementing those mandates by cutting out some of their elements?
But obviously we cannot ignore the cost.
So we have to be able to do that exercise.
So that's the question, a final question.
The suggestion which makes a lot of sense when mandates are being are asking for within budgetary resources, but in fact that's not possible.
There's a suggestion that there's more flexibility given to the Secretary General to be able to allocate those limited resources to different mandates.
Like I said, that makes a lot of sense.
We do not have unlimited money, obviously, and that's why we're having this exercise in addition to trying to make our lives better and more effective at the un stop renegotiating things all over again and bring a collective power together as Member States to implement things we have decided.
But what criteria would the Secretary General then use, do you think or has used up to now that you consider particularly effective in making those decisions on how to allocate those more limited resources through increased flexibility.
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of the European Union.
I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of China

**China | Representative**

Co Chairs.
Mandate creation marks the beginning of the mandate life cycle.
Just like fasten the first button on a shirt, it must be done properly from the start Listening.
I listened very carefully with the briefings and I would like to raise three questions.
First, regarding the online registration of mandates, could you please provide information on the resources that have been invested in the development of the registration system so far, as well as the resources and funding resources that will be required in the future?
Second, only corresponding resources for mandate creation.
The Secretary General's report recommends strengthening the linkage between mandate creation and corresponding resources and providing more comprehensive budget estimates for new mandates.
What impact would this have on the current budget preparation process, in particular on the work of the Committee for Program and Coordination and the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly?
Third, concerning the use of artificial intelligence, what type of data does the Secretariat intend to feed into these tools?
What measures are planned to ensure the secure management of this entire process, including data input, content generation, result verification and integration and optimization?
And what is the estimated financial cost of these activities?
And I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Co Chair by circulating the work of plan which demonstrate a spirit of openness and transparency.
In conclusion, I want to strike a optimistic tone now.
The Secretariat and also the UN's work is multiplying in terms of the rapid change of international situation.
So we need to really keep the work with the pace of the times, rather than simply compare this times work with the work we have done before and label the previous previous work as a failure.
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of China.
And I'll give the floor to the distinguished representative of South Africa, to be followed by Liechtensteinstein.

**South Africa | Representative**

Thank you Co Chair.
And thanks to both of you for this.
Having listened and recognizing the one thing that came through was the design.
So I must congratulate both of you for thinking carefully about the design of this process.
I think this discovery phase will benefit not only us, but the entire system.
So I just want to register South Africa's appreciation for the discovery phase that you've done throughout the process and of course for sharing it openly with all of us.
And thank the presenters as well.
I think your process design ensures that there's partnerships with the system and Member States.
So thank you to the system for helping us understand deeper Two questions from our side.
One is understand the preambler paragraphs and their purpose, understand the operative paragraphs and this is where you extract the mandate.
But can you tell us how you do that, given that some of the operative paragraphs are not very clear?
So if you can share that, it will be very helpful.
Similarly, appreciating the registry that you have put together, is there any way we can classify the mandates to say these ones that are asking for reports and there are so many of them, these are the ones that are creating new entities and there are so many just some kind of classifying mandates.
Thank you.
Thank you again.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of South Africa.
I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Liechtenstein to be followed by the United States.

**Liechtenstein | Representative**

Thank you so much to both of you all.
Protocol observed and thanks to the, to the briefers extremely helpful briefings presentations this morning.
Morning.
And we do, we do like this format so thank you for this.
I will have a couple of questions.
I mean it was particularly useful for me to hear the comments on the budget.
I think the term visibility was used quite a bit.
What we are looking for a little more is also transparency because I think the reality is we often don't know how much the things cost that we mandate.
And my experience is also that we often actually don't know if a mandate that we're drafting is, is linked to a PBI until extremely late.
So I've been involved in negotiations or it's like oh this is a big question.
Is there going to be a PBI or is there no pbi?
But I think the reality is also even without a PBI a resolution does entail costs.
So that is for us important.
And we'll comment on other issues such as SG reports and the famous phrase within existing resources when we have this opportunity.
In informals my questions are linked to my brief comments and the first is what methods can be used to link newly created mandates in the future with the reduction of consolidation of older ones in order to maximize the efficiency of the use of resources.
Think that links also you know the forward looking perspective that that has been advocated in the discussion with what we also need to address as far as what you already have.
And the second question relates also to my comments namely what additional information can be provided besides regular budget estimates to ensure full funding transparency for newly created mandates.
Because I really think that has been one of the the things that we have not been doing well on, well at all on in the past and something that I hope can be fixed relatively easily.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Thank you.
I thank the distinguished representative of Liechtenstein.
I give the floor to the distinguished representative of the United States who will be followed by Malaysia.

**United States | Representative**

Great.
Thank you so much.
Kirk chairs and thanks to all the panelists today.
Just a couple questions and reactions to follow up on the very useful briefings today.
First to Yaku Suzuki.
One of the recommendations that you discussed is around giving the Secretariat appropriate flexibility to assign responsibility based on comparative advantage.
And I think it would be useful to have more information on what the that would actually look like if there are examples in existing mandates that perhaps could serve as a model as we consider new mandates.
Similarly, you talked about, I think the very useful mandate report that the SG produced.
I was particularly struck by the the graphic on the last page of that report, which is the heat map looking at overlap across the three pillars of the organization.
It would be useful to have a better understanding of clusters of similar mandates that could be potentially a basis for us as Member states to think about consolidation or deconfliction.
And the representative of the European Union talked about which mandates were the most expensive.
It might also be useful to have a good sense of what mandates do we spend the most time on.
And then finally to Christophe Monnier, wearing my 5C hat, a lot of that was of course very familiar.
I think it's worth noting that when we use within existing resources and mandates, it's often a political compromise.
It's because some in the room don't like the mandate, some do.
And the sort of most expedient way of reaching agreement is to say, fine, you can do that, but with no new money.
And with that in mind, I think it would be helpful to know both how the Secretariat determines whether, as you said, in circumstances where we have mandated doing something within existing resources, additional resources are needed, or if the Secretariat cannot actually implement the mandate.
And similarly, should we be thinking about a threshold below which the Secretariat can absorb those resources, or above which resources actually would be necessary for implementation?
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the Distinguished Representative of the usa.
I give the floor to distinguished Representative of Malaysia, to be followed by the Republic of Korea.

**Malaysia | Representative**

Thank you, Co Chair.
Thank you for convening today's briefing and I also thank the Briefers for their useful presentation.
I have a question to Ms. Suzuki with regards to the mandate registries.
As noted in the Report of the Secretary General, the availability and accessibility of information on existing mandates remain limited.
Malaysia joins those who believe that improving access to this information could contribute to more informed and effective decision making by Member States as part of our broader efforts at reform.
We also note and support the recommendation to accelerate the creation of comprehensive registries of existing mandate tax issued by all mandating bodies.
And we are also encouraged to see that at least the beta version of the UN Mandate Registry has been online and is being expanded in the coming weeks.
So my question is, is there a sense of timeline for the completion of the mandate source registry?
And my second question would be what are the potential persistent challenges that are being faced in building and completing this registry?
Thank you so much.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Malaysia.
And I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of the Republic of Korea, to be followed by El Salvador.

**Korea, Republic of | Representative**

Thank you for the briefing.
I have a couple of questions.
The SG report identifies excessive prescriptiveness as a problem which may seem a bit counterintuitive because specificity is generally virtue in drafting clear mandates.
Is the concern primarily about assigning tasks to specific entities or does it extend to mandates that prescribe in detail how active activities should be done and also for visibility?
I wonder myself, would the registries at the current format be sufficient perhaps to avoid duplication, but not so much to ensure coherence to give Member State a full insight of how the existing mandates or duplicative mandates are implemented, coordinated or funded.
I just want to listen to how you are going to improve this mandate registry.
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of the Republic of Korea.
I give the floor now to El Salvador to be followed by Romania.

**El Salvador | Representative**

Thank you so much Co Chairs for convening this meeting and also to the briefers for the valuable presentations and also to the Secretary for all the efforts highlighting the presentation that Ambassador Maritza Chai gave us.
Very comprehensive and with a lot of food for thought precisely in our work.
I would like to know if you Co Chairs have also engaged with other Member States precisely that have led intergovernmental processes recently to draw lessons from them that could inform the current review mandate that especially because the report was presented last August and the first meeting was in mid September on the creation of mandates.
More specifically and within the context of the current Main Committees now in session.
We would like to know if there have been exchanges between the Secretariat Co Chairs of different processes and the Chairs especially of the main Committees to raise awareness of the need to avoid repeating the same pace of creating countless new mandates.
Also have the discussions taken place within the committees and that's related from what was previously mentioned of the use of within existing resources when establishing new mandates.
And that's precisely seeing what in the framework of the main Committees could be done to avoiding that use of the phrase, whether for political reasons or others.
Other questions that we have is regarding the paragraph 29B of the SG report when referring to the need of frame mandates that allow the Secretary General flexibility to assign task based on comparative advantages and resources across the UN system Co Chairs, what exactly will that flexibility mean in practice and related to mandate implementations?
Very concrete questions is that has the Secretary identified a sense of competitiveness between agencies within the system, and are there any considerations regarding these cases in the field based, for instance, on the findings of the multiple QCPR reports during the last few years?
Thank you, Co Chairs.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Thank you so much.
To the distinguished representative of El Salvador.
I give the floor now to Romania, to be followed by Pakistan.

**Romania | Representative**

Thank you very much, Co Chairs.
And I think I used this analogy before.
You are making us looking in the mirror because at the end of the day, Member states are responsible for this important phase of the mandates creation.
And I think your brief has covered several important angles.
I'm looking at Mintu and I'm wondering if we did not manage it 20 years ago, what would make us confident that we'll make it this time?
I think we have to make it this time because there is no, this is not optional.
Mrs. Suzuki spoke about the design that drives delivery.
This is correct.
This is something that we've been looking at together with Matu in the revitalization resolution, how to make resolutions, you know, more streamlined.
The demand has to be clearly codified.
But I'm still concerned.
I mean, if we did not manage to do it 20 years ago, what would it take it this time?
And I'm interested from, from the Secretariat, probably, and all the panelists, what exactly benchmarks, criterias we may develop in addition to what we had developed so far?
I very much like the presentation on the financial impact of our mandates and the way we have explained what exactly a mandate means.
And it is correct in my understanding as well, a resolution simply requesting the Secretary General, producer mandate, a report, it's a mandate.
And I'm interested, actually, can we go back to the basics in a way, looking at what exactly does it mean from a financial perspective, what is the expenditure related to such a simple task?
Because the way I see it, and that's the mirror that we have to look into, we're not even observing our own rules of procedures throughout these processes that we promote through different committees of resolutions.
We're actually supposed to quantify the financial impact of those resolutions so it doesn't happen.
So I would be very much interested how we can quantify in practical terms such a request to produce a report, because it will be giving an important visual for member States.
The other point I would like to ask is we scatter different mandates through different resolutions in different bodies.
What would be a good way, actually, to make sure that we avoid this duplication and this overlap?
Sometimes we talk about.
We saw the example with the youth item being handled in a number of resolutions through different bodies, some of them not being in New York.
So that's probably one of the key issues that we have to look at.
I wonder if any of the panelists may have a different input.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Thank you.
I thank the distinguished representative of Romania.
I give the floor now to Pakistan to be followed by Mozambique.

**Pakistan | Representative**

Thank you very much Co Chairs, for convening this briefing.
We also thank all the panelists for their insightful presentations.
I will save our substantive reflections on the proposals in the SG's report for the next meeting and limit this intervention to three points on which we desire greater clarity.
First is on one of the key issues identified in the SG's report that many entities are citing the same mandates in their pbis, implying possible duplicates duplication of efforts to address this.
The report recommends that greater flexibility be granted to the SG to assign tasks when designing or implementing mandates.
From our perspective, the solution proposed is not necessarily in line with the problem identified.
The question would be is it possible for the Secretariat to provide more in depth analysis on how the proposal in the the report would enhance efficiency?
In our view, if the mandates formulation remains unclear, it would lead to delays in implementation, interagency conflict, etc. It is the Member States who should spy specify the implementing entity and the Secretariat which should provide adequate support to Member States to make an informed decision.
Second is on the proposal for linking new mandates to corresponding resources or reductions elsewhere.
We can agree to this principle when Member States are creating new mandates to be implemented within existing resources.
However, applying such a principle to all new mandates is a point of concern.
We cannot expect the UN to respond to new emerging challenges if PBIS are our overarching concern.
So the question here is can the Secretariat inform whether this principle is implementable on all new mandates and not just those which are specified to be implemented within existing resources and what this would imply in practice for recent new mandates.
Third, we agree with the proposal for accelerating the creation of comprehensive registries of existing mandate text issued by all mandating bodies.
We recall that the 2006 exercise highlighted by Ms. Fam also created a mandate Registry, but we are unaware of its fate.
We would like to ask the Secretariat what arrangements are in place to ensure that such registries remain in place even after the Unity Initiative is completed, and we would also be very happy to hear what what you have to respond to the Chinese question about what resources are being spent on the Registry.
The creation of the Registry itself.
Thank you so much.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished Representative of Pakistan.
I give the floor now to the Distinguished representative of Mozambique, to be followed by Ireland.

**Mozambique | Representative**

Thank. Thank you Chair.
Our co Chairs and we also welcome this discovery phase.
And for us this is not only a forward looking exercise.
Even as we meet today, new mandates are being created making this a particularly hands on and practical exchange for certain countries such as mine.
Strengthening the connection between the political decisions that create mandates and the budgetary realities that sustain them has real life implications.
Let me pose a couple three or four questions.
First, on visibility and mandate registries, does the Secretariat intend to expand the registry to include specialized agencies so that duplication can be addressed system wide rather than only within the Secretariat?
Second, has the Secretariat considered developing model drafting guidance or templates to help delegations avoid the pitfalls that were mentioned such as prescriptive language, the famous within existing resource clauses and others.
Third, on AI, will we Member States be consulted on the criteria and methodology those systems will use to flag duplication and complementarities?
And finally, in what ways can regional commissions such the eca, the Economic Commission for Africa, contribute to or manage regional mandate registries to enhance coherence in regional ownership?
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Mozambique.
I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Ireland, to be followed by Cuba and then the Russian Federation.

**Ireland | Representative**

Thanks very much co facilitators, and thank you to all the wonderful briefings that we had this morning.
Much appreciated.
One question I had is for Mr. Monnier from the Executive Office of the Secretary General.
You spoke about reviewing the mandates annually and identifying mandates that no longer require to be referenced.
That's a useful process that you're going through and would be useful to hear more about that and perhaps how it can feed into the current deliberations.
And secondly, and finally, yes, we've spoken about the mapping of mandates that we have currently.
Which ones are the most expensive, which ones take up the most time or two elements, I would add, which ones have the most impact?
But of course that also relates to what Minh Tu was saying.
How do we evaluate?
How are we able to tell where the impact and results are?
So very supportive of thoughts in that regard as we go forward.
Thank you very much.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Ireland.
I give the floor now to Cuba, to be followed by the Russian Federation.

**Cuba | Representative**

Thank you so much Chair for giving me the floor and thanks for this opportunity.
We have three questions.
First, regarding the ongoing initiative to improve the visibility of the mandate landscape, referring para.
23 of the Secretary General's report, how has the allocation of resources being managed in the context of the equate liquidity crisis facing the Organization for the implementation of these initiatives?
Second, regarding the recommendation to grant the Secretary General greater flexibility in mandates to assign tax to entities within the system, taking into account the points raised in para.
28 of the report, we would like to know the criteria or procedures that will be taken into account to assess the suitability of giving entity to implement a mandate.
And third, concerning the use of artificial intelligence to support the creation or drafting of mandate text, how will it be ensured that that the relevant political analysis and sensitivity of each issue analyzed by the Organization will not be undermined?
Could the Secretariat provide an exhaustive list of the areas of the organizations where in which AI is being implemented?
What AI tools are currently in use by the Organization or are being considered for use?
How can it be ensured that they are fully respectful of Member States, their positions and their perspective?
We would like appreciate receiving right information from the Secretariat for the next sessions of the Ad hoc Working Group.
Thank you so much.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the representative of Cuba and I'll give the floor to the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation, to be followed by Nigeria.

**Russian Federation | Representative**

Thank you very much.
Ambassadors and colleagues in the Secretariat.
I think we have to be thankful to all of us.
We're starting the frank conversation which is long overdue.
With that frank conversations, my questions are the following.
As I mentioned last time, I would love to address not only the part actions by the Member States, but also the part actions by the Secretary General.
So I see two conflicting points.
One is that the Secretary General is going to approve Secretariat support and the other is that the Secretary General is going to provide shorter reports.
So my question is how do these two combine with each other?
Because in my opinion, shorter reports are not improved support.
Does it mean that the UN Secretariat wants to work less?
And does the working less means that the UN Secretariat is ready to receive reduced salaries?
My second question also concerns the appropriate flexibility to assign tasks by the Secretary General.
We would love to ask how does this is commensurate with the prerogatives of the Member States to control the implementation of mandates.
And how does this impact the accountability of the Secretary General?
My last point would also the also address the flexibility.
Not flexibility, sorry.
Also address the conditionality of mandate with the resources.
The clause that says that the impact has to be defined first, the source of funding has to be defined first.
How does this impact the prerogatives of Member States in determining the provision program of the organization?
And last issue just echo the questions about existing resources clause.
We understand this is quite a difficult sometimes an outcome for Member States to arrive into decision and consensus.
But how the Secretary choose and prioritize in the conditions where it's clearly that resources are not enough.
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation.
I give the floor to the distinguished representative of Nigeria, to be followed by Iran and then our final speaker will be Argentina.

**Nigeria | Representative**

Thank you the Co Chairs for this wonderful job.
Be rest assured of my delegations full support for achieving a positive outcome in the ongoing review mandates in line with the results or guidelines of giving to the Committee.
While we share the view that it is important to look forward, we must also recognize that understanding where we are coming from is fundamental to determine where we are going.
A clear appreciation of past mandates and experiences enable us to build more coherent and effective path for the future.
The Secretary is always supportive of Member States in terms of resolutions making by extension mandate creation from language, form illumination going forward.
So what is the support again that is needed different from what they are doing or giving to Member States and how can they do better?
I will appreciate for these cautions.
Then lastly, on the issue of duplications of mandates, as highlighted, resolutions from the ga, ECOSOC and Security Council which according to the representative of the Secretariat, how can this time around be better than the previous time given that the administrative bureaucratic process of monitoring and evaluating of this this mandate.
And once again I want to also, what do you call it?
Ask the question related to what my distinguished colleague from Cuba, on the issue of AI, how are we looking at the transparent usage of the AI?
As well as my colleagues from Mozambique, who is talking about entities in terms of their mandate.
How can we look at the review as well as the registry creation for their respective mandate?
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Nigeria.
I give the floor now to Iran, to be followed by Argentina and then finally Mexico.

**Iran, Islamic Republic of | Representative**

Thank you Excellencies, Co Chairs.
All protocols observed.
I also wish to thank the Co Chairs for their attention to the past experiences and to the lessons learned from them.
A meaningful step forward.
As we have previously requested, I wish to raise two questions.
First is concerning the artificial intelligence.
And as as some colleagues previously said, we know that AI tools are subject to bias and exclusivism and more importantly remain costly and insufficiently developed for application, especially in the highly sensitive context.
There are already concerning examples in the context of the un, such as speech to text tools and we all recognize that it is still an evolving technology.
Then how do you evaluate this as a supportive element to achieve inclusive outcomes under current financial situation?
Second, it relates to the ambiguous Language of mandates, often the result of delicate political compromises which frequently requires clarification during implementation.
I would be interested to know whether there is any reflection or statistical data show showing to what extent this ambiguity consumes the Secretariat's time and energy in the interpretation and how often we encounter situations where Member States or groups later express their concerns that the implementation did not fully reflect their intended meaning.
Thank you so much.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Iran.
I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Argentina and then Mexico.

**Argentina | Representative**

Thank you very much.
Mr. Co Chair of Protocol observes.
I have a question in the context of Rule 153 that was mentioning and the question is what challenges or limitations?
Or maybe, if you want to see positively what possibilities do we have to count with PBA estimates well in advance?
I would say maybe when the zero draft is presented so we can incorporate the budgetary implications from the beginning of a discussion when a mandate is created and not, I would say at the end, as it is now in the context of the procedure, maybe that would allow us to incorporate from the 0 draft the PBI implications and all be aware of what that means in the context of mandate negotiation.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Thank you.
I thank the distinguished representative of Argentina and now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Mexico who will be our last speaker.

**Mexico | Representative**

Thank you very much.
And I would like to thank the briefers for the very clear and comprehensive presentations.
My country, Mexico will be presenting its position on how we see the whole process in a thorough Way on October 23rd.
But in the meantime we would like to ask Ms. Mintu Pam if she could go a little bit more into detail on evaluation and monitoring in the creation of new mandates.
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Mexico.
And I thank the distinguished representative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for making a liar out of me.
I give the floor to the representative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

**Netherlands | Representative**

Thank you Ambassador.
And thank you Co Chairs for the inclusiveness of this process.
We're looking forward also to the next briefings and avenues for discussion.
We also have some questions.
First of all, we welcome the establishment of the Registry of Mandates that has the potential to be a useful tool to support states improve mandate design and reduce duplication.
What functionalities do you envisage to strengthen its usefulness?
A second question would be to ask the Secretary General for a timeline on the implementation of the recommendations of the SG's report.
We already saw some shortened reports passing by which we greatly value, but we would like to have additional information on the implementation of the recommendations.
On your side, slide AI tools.
The third question on AI tools, they have obviously a huge potential to support more informed decision making by States.
How do you foresee the implementation of such tools in this process?
And I thank you very much for your attention.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
And with that I try to hand the floor back over to my co chair for some summary remarks.

**IAHWG | Carolyn Schwalger | Co-Chair**

Thank you, Ambassador Wallace.
And first of all, thank you to all of you.
I cannot say how much we appreciate the trust that you have placed in us by working with us in the format and the process as we've prescribed.
And we can see that in the presentation of your question and kind of early markers of your intent to come back with fuller ideas and proposals at the session on the 23rd of October.
I'd also like to thank the briefers.
Each one of you, in your own ways, I think, brought different aspects of this discussion on mandate creation to the fore.
This discussion was very rich.
It's hard to summarise, but let me at least just touch on a few points before we close on what I think we may have heard today.
I was very taken by Mintu's comment that quiet systems make multilateralism work.
And I think that is so true and that is the exercise we're embarked on.
So it's so great to hear from so many of you that you welcomed the opportunity to hear from some of the lessons we've learned in the past so that we can apply those to our work now and in the future.
I heard a lot of commentary around there is a great desire to have better design of the way we make mandates and the reason for that is because we all want to have better delivery and better impact.
That came through from both our presenters and from you as well.
Having said that, it was always.
It was also acknowledged in this discussion that because of the way we negotiate as Member States together, of course some of the ways that we create mandates are a product of our own decision making and sometimes come with unintended consequences, but sometimes come with intended consequences as well.
And of course that is completely legitimate.
It, however, does raise questions around clarity.
We had comments and questions around how are mandates sourced out of the system?
How does the Secretariat interpret what we produce as Member States?
And we asked and heard a lot of questions around more information.
A desire for increased visibility so that that can support delivery.
But also transparency came through very strongly as well.
It was noted by some in their questions in the briefers that ambiguity can cause challenges for the Secretariat, but can cause challenges for us as Member states too, and our own evaluation or satisfaction on how we believe that mandates are delivered upon or not.
There was much discussion around the relationship between the creation of mandates and how resources are allocated to those mandates.
Both comments and questions around the information that we need before we start and the better information and understanding of the financial impacts of mandates perhaps before we conclude them.
A very strong theme came through today about the importance of monitoring and evaluation, the importance of having better assessments of what we've actually done to inform what we do in the future.
And I heard clients comments and questions around not only the impacts of mandates on our finances and our funding, but also on our time and also on our impact.
So we have questions there for the briefers as well.
Many of you referred to the SG's report.
Many of you welcomed some of the recommendations.
Many of you had questions about some of the recommendations, whether they were the right recommendations, and some of you who had questions asking for elaboration on some of them as well.
There were many questions and comments around the tools, the registry that's been mentioned.
What is its functionality, how is it being resourced?
We had questions about AI, how can AI help us?
But also what are some of the caveats we need to consider when we think about the use of AI in this exercise.
Many of you ask questions of about what does giving the SG increased flexibility mean in terms of allocating parts of the system to deliver on mandates.
And there was a lot of discussion around the implications of within existing resources.
We heard from a couple, including Maritza, about how SG reports are consumed, one of the frequent mandates that we see in resolutions, and there was an encouragement to move from compilation of information to analysis.
We also of course heard questions beyond the recommendation in the SG's report and we started to see some flavour and hints of things that you might bring back to us on the 23rd as well.
I think there's a great desire to see how the tool that the Secretariat has developed and maybe outside of this format we can ask the Secretary Secretariat to provide a very informal, informal meeting sometime between now and the 23rd where they can show you your experts how the tool works and you can see some of the functionality by testing it on a few case studies that might be something we will commission from the Secretariat.
So that was my attempt to summarise this hour and a half or so or almost two hours this morning.
I think it's been a really rich discussion and as co chairs we're really thrilled and I'm looking forward to hearing more from you.
On the 23rd, but also, of course, before that, as we said at the first session, we remain available to you to meet you individually, to meet you in groups, to meet you in clusters who are interested in particular aspects of this process.
So thank you very much again for today.
And I have to do the formalities to get close us out.
So before adjourning, as previously announced, the next meeting will take place on the 23rd of October.
As I said, in the interim, if you wish to meet with us directly in person or by in writing, you can also do so to the email address that we provided in the letters on 7th and 10th of October.
But for today, this meeting is adjourned.
Thank you.
