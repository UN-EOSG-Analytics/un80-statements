# Session 1 | First meeting of the working group (Sep 16, 2025) 

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

Colleagues, if you could please be seated so that we can begin.
Thank you.
I call to order the first meeting of the Informal Ad Hoc Working Group.
On behalf of the co chairs, I extend a warm welcome to all of you to this first meeting of the Informal Ad Hoc Working Group.
I would like to recognize the presence of the President of the General Assembly, Her Excellency Annalina Baerbock and Mr. Guy Ryder, under Secretary General Policy in the Executive Office of the Secretary General.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Madam President, in our role as Co Chairs of the Informal Ad Hoc Working Group, we congratulate you on your election and wish you a fruitful 80th session of the General Assembly.
As members are aware in its decision 79571 of 2 September 2025, the General assembly decided to establish an Informal Ad Hoc Working Group open to all Member States and observers to consider options to improve the creation, delivery and review of UN mandates.
The establishment of this group is a milestone within the broader UN80 initiative, and new Zealand and Jamaica are honored to co chair its work.
Today we gather with a clear sense of purpose to take forward the mandate entrusted to us by the Assembly.
In the spirit of cooperation, openness and trust that defines multilateralism at its best, our leaders have called for a United nations that is more effective, more efficient and fit for purpose.
As it marks its 80th anniversary, this working Group is one expression of that collective ambition, and it is for us, the membership, to shape how that conviction is translated into practice.
We meet today to set out our understanding of the task before us and to engage with you on how we can best work together to complete it successfully.
While we have some initial thoughts on how we might proceed, today is not about prescribing a roadmap.
It is about listening, taking stock of your perspectives, and beginning to build a common understanding of the way forward.
Mandates derive from the will of Member States, and it is vital that all delegations have the opportunity to contribute.
We are therefore committed to proceeding in a manner that is fully open, transparent and inclusive, ensuring that the Working Group reflects the the broadest possible participation and ownership.
At the same time, we are mindful of the Assembly's clear instruction that we must strive for consensus as we begin to prepare a program of work and plan our way forward.
We are eager to hear from you so that we can be sure that our proposed approach aligns with the needs and wishes of the membership.
We also recognize the many demands on delegations, particularly smaller missions, in the months ahead.
And for this reason we see value in beginning with a Discovery Phase A period of wide consultations to gather perspectives, to clarify priorities and to build shared understandings.
This will allow us to develop a package of principles and follow up actions that could form the basis an agreed outcome.
This phase will be fully open and inclusive and organized in a way that is sensitive to the competing demands on delegation's time.
We will also draw on the best data analysis and expertise available, including through active support from the Secretariat.
And we thank the Under Secretary General for his firm commitment in this regard.
It is also clear to us that there are many outside the Working Group who wish to contribute ideas for our collective consideration.
We welcome this and will facilitate it as part of the Working Group process while preserving the Member State driven nature of our discussions.
We will aim to complete this phase in time to report back to the membership by the 15th of December in line with the Assembly's request, before moving into a production phase to finalize outcomes by March 2026.
With that, I now pass the floor to Ambassador Schwargov for some additional comments.

**IAHWG | Carolyn Schwalger | Co-Chair**

Thank you Ambassador Wallace and good morning everybody.
President of the General Assembly Under Secretary General Guy Ryder and all of our colleagues.
It's so great to see so many of you here this morning.
The General assembly has given us clear direction.
We are tasked with identifying principles and follow up actions to improve the creation, delivery and review of mandates.
The Secretary General's report on the Mandate Implementation Review provides a useful starting point for these discussions.
It provides a number of proposed solutions and follow up actions for for implementation by the UN Secretariat in support of Member States.
We will invite the UN Secretariat to provide the Working Group with updates on implementation of those proposals that sit within their authority at appropriate moments during this process.
The report also proposes a range of actions that Member States could take to enhance mandate design, improve mandate delivery and support mandate Review as you engage in the Working Group, we would welcome your feedback on these proposals, focusing on those actions which you consider most important to progress and or those where Member States could achieve some quick wins.
We also understand that Working Group members will also have ideas of their own on concrete actions we can take beyond those proposed in the Report.
We encourage you to bring these to the consideration of this Working Group.
Let us also assure you that we have learned many lessons from the last mandate review almost 20 years ago.
One of the key findings of that process was the impossibility of trying to have a Working Group such as this make judgments on individual mandates.
As Co Chairs, we intend to focus our attention at the system level.
We will not be considering individual mandates in this Working Group.
Further, as Co Chairs, we think it will be important to focus on the future so that we can be more effective and efficient with with limited resources.
We want to hear from you what that future might look like.
How can Member States, who are responsible for the adoption of mandates, be more effective and more efficient in future?
What principles should underpin how we work together as Member States to strengthen the impact of the United nations, to improve delivery across all pillars of of our work?
And what principles should underpin our partnership with the Secretariat going forward?
As Co Chairs, we do not intend to prejudge what the outputs of the Working Group should be or what form these might take, although we can imagine a scenario where they might involve a combination of different elements.
This is for the Working Group members to determine together.
We want to hear from you today and in the coming weeks about your desired level of ambition and what good might look like in terms of our outputs.
We hope to forge consensus amongst Working Group members on some principles to underpin how we collectively keep better sight of the overall mandate landscape, how we deal with duplication and overlap between mandates and what we do with mandates which might have outlived their original purpose.
We will be asking you how we can mitigate the unreasonable burden these aggregated instructions place on us as Member States and on the UN system, as well as what principles might underpin the creation of mandates that translate into clearer, fairer and more sustainable resource allocations.
We will also need to consider how any principles and actions we agree should be applied in practice, including in relation to mandates originating in UN bodies outside of New York.
With that, I would now like to pass the floor to my Co Chair, Ambassador Wallace, to outline our thinking on the relationship between the Mandate process and the wider UN80 initiative process process.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Ambassador, thank you so much.
Co Chair.
We acknowledge that this process will unfold in parallel with the other UN 80 work streams on operational efficiencies and structural and programmatic changes.
We will therefore remain attentive to developments across the Initiative, while keeping our focus firmly on the mandate provided to this Group Group by the General Assembly.
Across all of our endeavors, we will be guided by the shared aspiration of the membership for a more effective and efficient United Nations.
The issues before us are significant, representing our collective strategic vision and operational expectations of the UN as a whole.
This is why at this stage, engagement at the level of permanent representatives is especially important.
The political vision and strategic direction you bring will provide the compass by which this process is steered.
With the expertise of colleagues to follow in due course as our work becomes more technical, colleagues as co chairs, we know the discussions ahead of us will be demanding and complex.
However, it is with optimism and conviction that we believe this Working Group provides an excellent opportunity to improve how the United nations delivers for the communities we serve.
The strength of this Working Group will not lie in a document or a deadline, but in the quality of dialogue we foster together.
If we succeed in creating a space that is constructive, candid and forward looking, we will have laid the foundation not only for this process, but for a stronger multilateral system.
Let us therefore seize this moment with a sense of common purpose and shared responsibility.
The United nations belongs to all of us and together we can ensure that it is equipped to meet the demands of today and the aspirations of tomorrow.
We thank you for the trust you have placed in us.
I now give the floor to the President of the General Assembly, Her Excellency Annalina Baerbock.

**GA | Annalena Baerbock | PGA**

Thank you, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, I'm pleased to join this inaugural meeting of the informal Ad hoc Working Group on the Mandate Implementation review under the UNAT initiative.
And I thank His Excellency, Mr. Brian Wallace, Permanent Representative of Jamaica, and Her Excellency, Ms. Carlene Schwalger, Permanent Representative of New Zealand, for their leadership and for bringing us together today.
I would like to also thank the Co Chairs of the revitalization process from Romania and South Africa.
We have worked also closely together and this is an outcome of your excellent work.
So thank you very much.
And I think the presence today underlines the importance of this Working group because we are living, as we have heard, in challenging times and therefore also all of us as General assembly, do have a special responsibility in this process to take forward the Secretary General's report on mandate implementation, to distill guiding principles and to chart the next step that will make our mandates clearer, more effective and more accountable.
Underlining that it's not only paper, but that it's really implementation which matters.
It builds on the dialogues begun last session by my predecessor, President Philemon Yang, and takes us to the next steps in this process.
And I'm also thankful to him and his team team for keeping me fully informed during the transition period.
And I intend to build upon their efforts and their open door.
I would like to also underline that this process of us as the General assembly is obviously part of the heart of the UNAD process on the adapting this organization for the 21st century.
Ensuring that our institution, that we are really fit for the future, that we really deliver as an institution on the efficiency level but also on the state of art level, like other institutions around the world.
And therefore, I would like to recall the three themes of the UN80 process.
Guy Raider will definitely go deeper into it, but I think it's good, good to have it always in mind when we speak about the mandates.
First, to sharpen the efficiency, which includes cutting bureaucracy, reducing cost.
We have learned altogether what every minute costs here and making smarter use of our global presence.
Second is the mandate review itself, ensuring the many tasks entrusted to the UN remain focused and relevant.
And third, consider the system as a whole, drawing on the first two streams to assess whether deeper structural or programmatic changes are needed.
So colleagues, in my opening address I spoke explicitly about this make it or break it moment, that this mandate review process is part of it, whether we make it or we break it.
And therefore, I believe and would like to underline what the co chairs have said, that we should take up this topic with a positive spirit, that we together can actually make it.
And that UN80 is not just an exercise in reform for reform itself.
Definitely not a cut cutting exercise for just cutting cost, but it's a chance for us to make this institution better and stronger together.
It is a chance to prove that the UN can deliver more effectively and accountably for the people and it serves.
And the mandate review is an essential component of this because this is about us.
This is where we as Member States, you and we as a GA in general can show that we are delivering, that we are leading by good examples ourselves.
Less than two weeks in office and already five mandate events plus two additional high level events are on the agenda next week.
So I for myself tasked myself to always think with every new mandate and every session I chair, what could I learn for the future, to make it in the future more effective and more accountable to the people.
Because I believe that the organization cannot continue to layer more mandates on top of old ones, but has to focus on delivery efficiency and effectiveness.
And therefore I would like to give you a very small example.
When we were preparing for now the upcoming high Level Speak week, like the ceremonial event on Monday, the Beijing platform based on resolutions and people told me, especially the Secretariat, every minute counts, it costs thousands of euro, but.
But then I have a resolution saying you should put 16 speakers in one hour.
So this doesn't work at all.
But I cannot do anything about it because it's in there in the resolution.
So I think looking really at this tiny examples where we can save a lot of money but also reflect all the time, not we've done it always like it always the speaker from there and there and there and there.
But just reflect how we can learn also from the past.
So definitely this is not an easy undertaking because everybody loves their darlings and this is I think also something which we could reflect to look really when we are presenting things, how we can lead by good examples.
Again, I'd like to underline what the co chairs have said.
Obviously it's not about now and the past, but looking for the future which also gives us strength that we can deliver on this very challenging timetable.
In this regard I applaud you of the timetable.
Yes, it's ambitious.
I've heard already that some people say it might be a bit too ambitious, but I would say if it would be easy then others could do the job.
So we work on that one together so that we can deliver as best as we can.
My office, the OPGA will support wherever support is needed.
Also on transparency because obviously trust is the base for the work here together.
So on this note I'm pleased that we were able to provide last minute also the public support for this discussion today and we are keen of keeping this transparency and the support also in the future.
So thank you very much for the exchange today and I'm really looking forward of working together.
On that one last mentioning, I would like to say I think it's of highest importance that this does not only stay in the room, but this is really taking up to senior level engagements.
So with the high level week ahead, please prepare every head of State and minister visiting the PGA that I will double check if they have heard about UNAT before and the mandate review because obviously it is also an opportunity where we can show all together that we are not only working here together in New York, but also in the capitals in this regard.
Looking forward to a great hey, Labor Week and also to a great working group.
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the President.
We have also requested Mr. Guy Ryder, under Secretary General for Policy in the Executive Office of the Secretary General to deliver some remarks on the support he and his team will be providing to this process.
I now give the floor to the Under Secretary General.

**UN Secretariat | Guy Ryder | USG Policy**

Thank you very much, President of the 80th session of the General Assembly.
Co Chairs of this informal ad hoc working group.
Let me begin by congratulating the co chairs, Ambassador Wallace and Ambassador S.H. schwalger for their appointment to co chair this informal ad hoc working group on the UN80 initiative.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Secretary General has welcomed the adoption of resolution 79318 which endorsed the overall direction of the UN 80 initiative and we have taken note of the General Assembly's encouragement to submit proposals to strengthen the impact and the agility of the United nations while reducing duplication and improving mandate delivery.
And as the President of the General assembly has indicated, the 80th anniversary is an important opportunity to build on and to intensify the reforms of past years.
The UN80 initiative aims to move us towards an effective and sustainable United nations and Decision 79571 established the Informal Ad Hoc Working Group and the decision establishes that the Working Group will consider in its scope the proposals contained in the Secretary General's report on the Mandate implementation review and identify principles and follow up actions in order to improve the creation, delivery and review of mandates.
The timeline set out in that decision is certainly ambitious and I want to recognise your efforts in organising Co chairs this first meeting exactly two weeks after the adoption of the decision and your appointment and let me just take a moment today to speak to the proposals contained in the report by the Secretary General as a, I hope, important input to the work of this Working Group and we would gladly provide a technical briefing on specific aspects of the report if you request it.
Let me speak first to the areas outlined in the report in which the Secretary General will act to improve support to Member States throughout the mandate life cycle and these are listed in the report on the Mandate Implementation Review.
To enhance mandate visibility and design, the UN system would accelerate the creation of mandate registries, improve Secretariat support, develop new tools and complement existing statements of expenditures with additional information on related programmatic activities.
To improve reporting, the UN system will provide shorter reports, combine reports, introduce different report formats and publish download statistics and to improve mandate delivery management, the UN system will strengthen internal oversight, review mandate citations, better use system wide coordination platform reforms and apply all UN system commitments in the Funding Compact and to establish effective review mechanisms, the UN system will increase use of existing mechanisms to identify opportunities to consolidate and to streamline work and to strengthen results based management.
The United Nations Systems is working on a roadmap on how these different actions can be taken by the UN system in each of these areas and we will be able to provide you with further information on this internal roadmap if the Working Group requires it at a future meeting.
If you request it, let me turn to the proposals now submitted by the Secretary General in his report on the Mandate Implementation Review that Member States may wish to consider as part of this intergovernmental process.
To enhance mandate design, Member States may wish to reduce the length of mandate texts, frame mandates to allow the Secretary General appropriate flexibility and refrain from mandating new tasks without corresponding resources.
To improve mandate delivery, Member States may wish to prioritise requests in mandates, fully apply all commitments by Member States through the Funding Compact and allow UN system entities greater flexibility to redeploy resources quickly and to support mandate review.
Member States may wish to systematise and to reinforce mandate review mechanisms, include expiry clauses and resolutions, introduce collective reviews of mandates and streamline how mandates are discussed.
Co Chairs, Distinguished delegates, in decision 79, 571, you have requested the Secretary General to provide substantive support to the Working Group as needed for the effective discharge of its mandate.
As you determine how you wish to organise the work of this Working Group, the UN system is at your disposal.
At the report's launch, many of you indicated that you would welcome further information on the data analysis and proposals across the mandate life cycle, and the Secretariat stands ready to provide an informal briefing on the data and insights in the report.
As we recognise in the report, ultimately, Member States are own the mandates that they give to the UN system and that Member States also decide on next steps.
We are here to be of assistance.
In your letter inviting me to this meeting, Co Chairs, you suggested that I speak to the support the UN system can provide to the Working Group's work, such as through the provision of additional data and analysis on each of the areas from the report that I have referred to in my remarks today, the UN system stands ready to provide you with that further information as you request it.
For example, with regard to what is already in the report, I indicated earlier that you could request us to provide information on internal actions that we are taking, and we can also provide further background on the proposals that the Secretary General suggested Member States might wish to consider themselves or on the date that underpins the report.
That said, as I have already indicated, it is for you to determine how you wish to organise this work and we remain at the full disposal of the Working Group.
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the Under Secretary General.
I now open the floor for statements by delegations.
Please press the microphone button if you wish to speak.
Please approach the Secretariat if you are speaking on behalf of a group of States.
Participants are reminded that statements are limited to five minutes for statements on behalf of groups and three minutes for statements in your national capacity.
Participants are also reminded to send their statement via the E Submit module on the Edelegate Platform.
Platform it's now my honour to give the floor to the Permanent Representative of Iraq, Speaking for the G77, the floor is yours.

**Iraq | Permanent Representative | (G77 + China)**

President of General Assembly Under Secretary General Excellencies Co Chairs I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the group of 77 and China.
@ the onset, allow me to congratulate both of you.
Her Excellency Caroline Schwalga and Permanent Representative of New Zealand and His Excellency Mr. Brian Wallace, permanent Representative of Jamaica, on your appointment as Co Chairs of the Informal Ad Hoc Working Group on the Mandate Implementation Review and the Work Stream 2 of the UN 80 initiative.
The group looks forward to working closely with you and we welcome that Our first meeting is dedicated to setting the tone of of the process.
The group views the UN8 initiative as an important step towards strengthening the role of the United nations in addressing global challenges.
We stress that any proposal under this Initiative and its three work streams must fully respect the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United nations as well as the intergovernmental nature of the organization.
The UN 80 process should reinforce, not dilute, multilateralism, ensure equitable participation of all Member States and address the priorities and concerns of developing countries.
The Group reaffirms the importance of learning from the past experiences to avoid repeating previous mistakes.
The earlier exercise, conducted about two decades ago, required significant effort but yielded limited results.
In this regard, the Group request a detailed briefing by the Secretary on that process, which extended over several years.
It would further assist in ensuring that the informal Ad hoc Working Group fully benefits the from prior lessons learned.
It's therefore crucial to build on the outcomes of every review process undertaken so far in order to prevent duplications of effort in a process that is itself aimed at avoiding redundancy.
We must build upon what has already been agreed on to ensure our collective effort are not wasted.
The Group underlines three guiding principles.
First, the spirit of consensus.
Second, Member State driven decision making and third, maintaining balance among the three pillars of the United nations.
With development as a parity.
The Group underscores the importance of ensuring that the establishment and work plan of the Ad Hoc Working Group are conducted in a manner that allows for meaningful and inclusive deliberations.
We therefore support adopting a flexible timeline for its meetings, taking into account the concern of Member States, particularly given that the main segment of the General assembly is already a period of intense engagement across the Preliminary and its six main Committees.
Such flexibility would help create a more conducive environment for constructive discussions and allow all delegations to participate effectively, including smaller ones.
Further, the Group underscored the importance of ensuring that negotiations and decision making processes are conducted in an open, transparent and inclusive manner through established intergovernmental arrangements, norms and procedures.
We trust that the future consideration of such important matters will be pursued on the basis of broad consultations, consensus and shared ownership among all Member States.
The group of 77 in China will also submit written responses to the Co Chair's guiding questions, underscoring our readiness to engage substantively in the next stages of the process.
To conclude, the group of 77 in China stresses that this first meeting is an important opportunity to set a constructive tone and to help shape a positive spirit for this process.
The Group reiterates its commitment to engage constructively and to ensure that this process remains inclusive, transparent and efficient with the full participation of all Member States.
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the Permanent Representative of Iraq and I now give the floor to the Permanent Representative of Singapore, speaking on behalf of a Group of Students States.

**Singapore | Permanent Representative | (SSG)**

Thank you very much.
Co Chairs, I have the honor to make this statement on behalf of the Small States Group ssg, which is a cross regional grouping of small States comprising developed and developing countries.
The list of countries that have aligned with this statement will be circulated after the meeting, but I'm pleased to inform members that this statement is supported by a group of 50 countries and we anticipate that more small States will join future statements within this Working Group.
The Small States Group welcomes the establishment of this informal Ad Hoc Working Group on Mandate Implementation Review.
We take this opportunity to congratulate the two Co Chairs on the appointment and we have every confidence that both of you will lead the process to a successful outcome for small States.
An Effective Multilateralism A multilateral system underpinned by respect for the UN Charter and international law is not an option, but an existential necessity.
The 80th anniversary of the founding of the UN is therefore not only a moment for reflection about the future of our multilateral system, it is also an opportunity to reform and re energize the un.
It is no secret that the multilateral system is under severe stress as a result of geopolitical tensions, economic fragmentation and unilateralism.
The establishment of this Working Group is therefore a timely and essential exercise to reposition the UN and streamline its work to deliver results for all our countries.
We wish to make three points.
First, the Ad Hoc Working Group is a Member States driven process.
It is therefore entirely in our hands to review all aspects of the mandate lifecycle as a means to reimagine and reposition the UN and to avoid duplication, enhance efficiency and deliver results on the ground.
There's no doubt that all three streams of the UN 80 initiative are interconnected and the success of this process will have an impact on the other two work streams.
With the use of new AI tools, we are better positioned to make sense of the UN mandates landscape in all parts of the UN ecosystem.
At this early stage of this process, we believe it is important to keep an open mind, not rule anything out and allow for a discussion of all proposals and perspectives.
Secondly, the ad hoc working group should be forward looking and ambitious while avoiding the pitfalls and politicization that plagued previous UN reform efforts.
While we should be ambitious, we should avoid an all or nothing approach.
It is important that we take an incremental and pragmatic approach that can show results in this regard.
Our work in this process must be based on data and analyses on the UN's mandates landscape which will provide evidence based insights on how best to move forward.
Ultimately, our objective is to achieve the effective implementation of mandates while avoiding duplication and inefficiencies.
In this regard, our process will strengthen the three pillars of the UN system so that it can deliver what has been agreed and adopted.
Thirdly, the success of this Working group depends on political will and mutual trust among Member States.
In this regard, we as a group of small States are committed to participating constructively to finding solutions and to build consensus.
We are encouraged by the fact that all Member States have acknowledged the need for a more efficient and stronger UN system.
This gives us hope that we can collectively find solutions for the benefit of all our countries and people quotas.
The UN 80 initiative is an opportunity to imagine a better future for the multilateral system.
In order for the UN to continue serving its purpose and our peoples, Member States must take responsibility in reshaping the mandate system which lies at the heart of how the UN functions and works.
We stand ready to work with the Co Chairs and with all Member States on achieving a meaningful mandate implementation review in line with the objectives of birth.
Thank you very much for your attention.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the Permanent Representative of Singapore speaking for the Small States Group.
And I now give the floor to the representative of guinea speaking for the African Group.
The floor is yours.

**Guinea | Representative | (Africa Group)**

Thank you. Co Chairs, Excellencies, I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the African Group.
At the outset, we wish to congratulate Ambassador Caroline Schwalger from New Zealand and Ambassador Brian Wallace from Jamaica on their recent appointment as Co Chairs.
We are confident in your leadership and abilities to steer our collective effort with utmost transparency and inclusivity, adhering to establishing the governmental norms and procedures that underpin this process, aligning with the statement from the Permanent Representative of Iraq on behalf of the group of 77 and China, the African Group wishes to make a few additional remarks.
We recognize the urgent need to streamline mandates to alleviate unnecessary administrative burdens on the United Nations.
The effectiveness of any reforms must enhance the Organization's responsiveness to the diverse priorities and pressing needs of Member States and the population we serve.
While we collectively recognize the importance of to enhancing mandate implementation and streamlining outputs, it is imperative that the core mandates across all three pillars of the United nations, particularly the Development Pillar, are preserved.
The Working Group should remain open and receptive to a broader array of ideas beyond those outlined in the Secretary General's Report.
Moreover, it is crucial to adopt a realistic and focused approach when establishing meaningful and achievable targets.
While ambition is important, it must align with existing realities to avoid repeating past failures in achieving intended outcomes.
The Working Group should not duplicate the work of existing bodies.
Rather, it should leverage those forums to address specific aspects, thereby allowing the Working Group to concentrate on its core objectives.
Furthermore, while the Secretariat plays a vital role in advancing efficiencies, intergovernmental organs must safeguard the integrity of mandates as outlined by the UN Secretary General.
Reform efforts should should proceed with full authority and oversight from Member States, ensuring transparency and inclusivity.
Our discussion must be guided by foundational principles.
Establishing realistic and achievable time frames is essential for interactive and constructive dialogues.
This will enable meaningful deliberation without the pressure of rushed timelines.
It is vital for the Working Group to be cognizant of the fact that many Member States will be actively engaged in the work of various committees and other processes which may hinder their ability to follow multiple discussions simultaneously.
A Member State driven approach will enhance the quality of our discussions, fostering creativity and innovation in addressing pressing issues.
We must cultivate a culture of consensus in decision making, promoting collaboration and valuing diverse viewpoints.
To effectively organize the agenda of the Working Group, we propose a phased instructor approach that allows an in depth examination of key issues.
Allocating adequate time for each phase is crucial for meaningful engagement.
Additionally, the agenda should reflect the priorities of all Member States while retaining the flexibility to adapt to evolving needs.
Implementing regular review points will facilitate the assessment of our progress and recalibrate discussions, ensuring a steadfast commitment to consensus and collaboration.
In conclusion, the African Group is committed to actively and constructively participating in the discussions of the informal ad hoc Working Group on the mandate implementation Review.
I thank you for your attention.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the representative of guinea speaking for the African Union.
And I now give the floor to the representative of the European Union.
The floor is yours.

**EU | Representative | (EU)**

Thank you, Madam Chair, Madam President or the General Assembly.
Mr. Undersecretary General Dear Co Chairs, I have the honor to speak on behalf of the European Union and its member states.
The candidate countries, Turkey, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania, Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Georgia, as well as Armenia, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino, align themselves with this statement at the outset, Allow me to thank the President of the General assembly for her important presence here today and to congratulate the permanent representatives of Jamaica and New Zealand on their appointments as Co Chairs of this informal ad hoc working group.
Dear Colleagues, you can count on the EU's full support to your work.
The European Union's member states are firmly committed to multilateralism and we are among the UN's leading political supporters and funders.
It is precisely because of this commitment that we engage in the UN80 process, recognizing it is a unique opportunity to build a stronger United nations, an organization where its members can make informed decisions, translate these into effective mandates, and ensure the organization efficiently can deliver real impact on the ground for the people it serves, especially for those furthest behind.
There is broad recognition that the mandate process has grown unwieldy and that we must look at this with renewed clarity of purpose.
We trust that under your guidance, this Working Group can help us review and streamline mandates, improve the creation and delivery, and increase accountability for impact.
This will set us on a path that strengthens the UN for the future.
In answering the questions that you have posed and following your guidance on how to best structure our discussion, allow me to share the European Union's views as on the question of how to make our discussions interactive, constructive and inclusive, the EU strongly supports a process that is open, transparent and participatory, where every voice can be heard and every delegation has a genuine role to play.
We believe that both informal dialogues and more structured meetings, regular opportunities for cross regional exchanges, and the early involvement of the Secretariat's expertise will be essential to keep discussions focused and constructive while ensuring that all perspectives are taken into account.
We would also encourage you to reach out to UN global hubs outside of New York to collect the fullest possible perspective on on mandate reform.
The Secretary General's and the Secretariat's expertise and analyses will be crucial in helping us make informed choices, improve efficiency and maximize the impact of our collective work.
Therefore, we should welcome the Secretariat's readiness to bring its full potential to bear under our guidance so that together we can succeed for the organization as a whole.
On the question of the organization of work and sequencing of discussions, we welcome Considering a phased approach, listening widely, consulting deeply and reflecting carefully, including in cross regional settings before moving into more prescriptive text based negotiations will help us all build a better understanding of the work ahead and of different initial ideas and concerns with an open mind and thus help us make more informed and consensual choices.
We see merit in organizing the initial period around thematic clusters such as Principles for the Mandate lifecycle, options for improving mandate creation and review, and approaches to implementation so that deliberations can progress in a logical sequence leading into your Progress report by 15 December 2025.
On the question of addressing the Secretary General's mandate Implementation Review Report and its recommendations, the EU believes the Working Group should focus on identifying systemic improvements and translating them into practical, results oriented outcomes.
At the same time, we should situate our work within the broader context of the UNAD initiative to ensure coherence and to avoid duplication.
In our view, a balanced approach drawing on the Secretariat's analytical input, past reform experiences and the priorities outlined in the Pact of the Future will give this group the opportunity to agree on principles as well as specific and concrete actions that can leave a lasting legacy that will guide the organization for years to come.
To repeat what we said from the very beginning of this process, in our view at least, the Pact should be our what and the UNAD our how for for guiding the UN's reform and future action.
In closing, Co Chairs, the European Union and its Member States stand ready at all levels to support you in this endeavor.
We are committed to working with you and with all delegations to turn this process into genuine collective success.
Together we can ensure that the UN is more effective and efficient, better equipped for the challenges of today and prepared for the demands of tomorrow.
Thank you.

I thank the Permanent Representative of the European Union and I now give the floor to the Permanent Representative of Palau speaking for AOCs.

**Palau | Permanent Representative | (AOSIS)**

The floor is yours, Madam President.
USG Rider distinguished CO Chairs, I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the alliance of Small Island States aoc.
We align with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of the group of 77 in China and wish to provide the following additional views that are specific to small island developing States at the outset.
AUSSIS extends our sincere congratulations to you Co Chairs on your appointment for this important process.
We're particularly pleased to see a fellow sids as well as a very good friend of sids leading our Working Group and you can count on our support and cooperation.
Distinguished CO Chairs as We mark the 80th anniversary of the United Nations, AOC sees this process as a vital opportunity to reaffirm the UN Charter while modernizing the organization's capacity to deliver for those who need it most, particularly sids.
Now allow me to respond to the three guiding questions before us.
First, on ensuring that our discussions are interactive, constructive, and inclusive.
As many of our members are represented by small delegations, convening meetings of the Working Group in parallel with those of the General Assembly's main Committees during the main session will inevitably prevent us from engaging meaningfully in the process.
Therefore, in order to ensure maximum participation by all delegations, efforts should be made to avoid scheduling meetings of the Working Group at the same time as the plenary meetings of the main Committees.
We also urge the CO Chairs to ensure early and transparent scheduling and circulation of background materials and to consider organizing most of the substantive work after the conclusion of the main session to ensure that we can all contribute fully to this important work.
Second, on organizing and sequencing our discussions While AOC prefers to begin the more substantive aspects of our work after the main session, we also recognize the CO Chair's mandate.
In the interim.
We believe that the Working Group could focus its effort on more thematic decision discussions guided by the three core areas of the Secretary General's Mandate Implementation Review Report.
These sessions would allow Member States to better understand the proposals under consideration, identify key questions, seek clarification and additional data from the report's authors where needed, and provide targeted inputs that can shape the direction of the review.
The goal during this initial phase should be to create a common understanding of the issues, identify areas of convergence, and lay the foundation for our more substant extent of work in 2026.
Third, on addressing the Secretary General's recommendations in the broader context of the UN80 initiative.
As indicated in our earlier statements, AUSIS welcomes the Secretary General's commitment to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the UN system.
The acknowledgement in his Mandate Implementation Review Report of systemic challenges such as fragmented implementation and uneven capacities are acutely felt by sids.
At the same time, reform should also preserve investments in programs that serve the most vulnerable.
Investment and development mandates, including those supporting the implementation of the Antigua and Barbuda agenda for sids should not be deprioritized under the guise of restructuring.
As such, AOC stresses that the Working Group's focus to consider proposals to review or realign mandates should aim to enhance the UN's ability to deliver on the mandates themselves and not result in reducing support for developing countries, particularly sids.
Ultimately, realignment must translate into improved mandate delivery for the people and countries who rely on the un.
The most distinguished Co Chairs.
In closing, AUSS stands ready to engage constructively with you and Member States through the group of 77 to ensure transparent, inclusive and Member States journey and process that strengthens the UN's delivery for all.
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the Permanent Representative of Palau speaking for aosis.
And I now give the floor to the Permanent Representative of Kuwait speaking for the gcc.
The floor is yours.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, I hate to interrupt you, but I am very sorry to inform you that the Working Group is not supported by translation.
I know this puts you in a really difficult position.
Where is Kuwait?
I can't see you.

**Kuwait | Permanent Representative**

Madam Co Chair, if I may add, I did check previously and I was told that there will be translation today.
But nonetheless it may be the case that we will have to send our statement then in English.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

Sure. I am also very happy to give you a moment if you wanted to think about presenting your key points to us in English.
So please let us know if you'd like to take the floor again.
We'll give you a moment to do that.
And again, on behalf of the Co Chairs, we really apologise for that misfortunate miscommunication.

**Kuwait | Permanent Representative**

Thank you, Madam Chair.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

Okay, please let us know.
All right, I'll now take the next speaker on our list.
And I give the floor to the Permanent Representative of Belize speaking for caricom.

**Belize | Permanent Representative | (CARICOM)**

Thank you, Madam Co Chair.
Madam President, USG Rider and Co Chairs.
I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the 14 member states of the Caribbean Community.
We align ourselves with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of the group of 77 in China and the statement delivered by Palau on behalf of the alliance of Small Island States.
Let me offer to both of you caricom's heartfelt congratulations on your appointment and assure you of our constructive engagement in this process.
CARICOM recalls its statement of 1st August on UN80 in in which we emphasize the need for clear, practical and equitable modalities that reflect the priorities of all Member States.
We underscored the imperative to deliver better results for people and planet anchored in adequate resourcing system, wide efficiency and above all, equity.
This holds true for the Mandate Implementation Review Co Chairs guided by these principles, CARICOM offers the following observations on your helpful guidance questions.
First, on building an inclusive process, the informal ad hoc working group process must ensure the full and meaningful participation of all delegations, especially smaller ones like ours.
Transparency, predictability and timely sharing of documents are essential to enable equitable engagement with with regard to engendering interactive approaches, we urge the avoidance of overlaps with main committees and plenary debates.
As just pointed out by eosis, structured but flexible engagement formats, including short interventions, focused clusters and informal exchanges can facilitate more interactive and inclusive discussions regarding the sequencing of work.
CARICOM urges that meetings early in the 80th session allow for robust Member States input as well as the provision of necessary data and analysis to inform our discussions and we thank USG Rider for offering the Secretariat support in that regard.
With this in mind and appreciating intimate connection across all UN80 work streams, we recommend an early mapping of the Secretary General's recommendations to identify priority areas for for collective attention, the CO Chairs could undertake a sequence approach, beginning with practical and cross cutting issues such as registries, reporting and financing, followed by thematic discussions on mechanisms like expiry clauses and review modalities.
We stress the importance of regular stock taking, ensuring Member States perspectives Guide the Coaches progress report in December of course CARICOM reaffirms the centrality of Member States authority over mandates reforms must preserve their prerogatives and must not dilute well established commitments and here we emphasize in particular those critical to small island developing States.
With regards to the UN Secretary General's report, we welcome aspects of the Secretary General's Mandate Implementation Review Report that enhance visibility and accessibility while providing safeguards for equity and oversight in areas such as artificial intelligence.
While we support greater efficiency, we have emphasized that it must never come at the expense of impact or equity for our countries.
Like other small island and low lying coastal states, accountability must go beyond aggregate system wide metrics to reflect the unique vulnerabilities and development needs of sids.
In closing, thank you very much Co Chairs and we look forward to engaging with you throughout this process.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the Permanent Representative of Belize speaking for caricom and I now give the floor to the Permanent Representative of Australia speaking for Cairns.

**Australia | Permanent Representative | (CANZ)**

Thank you very much indeed Chair and congratulations to both Co Chairs on their appointment.
This has been very significant as an exercise.
Thank you President of the General assembly for joining us this morning and also to USG Guy Ryder.
I have the honour to speak, as you mentioned, on behalf of Canada, New Zealand and my own delegation Australia.
We welcome the establishment of this informal ad hoc working group to develop principles and actions to improve the creation, delivery and review of mandates.
Today represents an important step in taking forward the UN 80 initiative process, and we're delighted to be in such capable hands and have great confidence in your leadership.
Our delegations acknowledge that the United nations is under pressure, demands for delivery are high and the financial situation is exceptionally challenging.
We're committed to working collaboratively in the Fifth Committee to support the adoption of the revised regular budget for this session.
We're also waiting with anticipation to see the Secretary General's proposals on structured reforms and program realignment in the near future.
While this Working Group is primarily focused on mandates, Cairns acknowledges the interconnected nature of the three UN 80 initiative work streams.
This Working Group will need to be mindful of the other UN80 work streams as it carries out its work if we're to achieve a UN system that that is more effective and responsive now and into the future.
We welcome the CO Chair's proposed approach as outlined this morning.
A process which is inclusive, transparent, data driven, creative, open minded, and which reflects the varied priorities of Member States and observers will be essential.
This Working Group provides an opportunity to take a more strategic approach to how mandates are created, funded, implemented and reviewed.
As noted on 1 August, Cairns welcomes the proposals in the Secretary General's Mandate Implementation Review Report as important substantive input to the work of the Working Group.
As we touched on the 2nd of September, we also believe the following points will be key to achieving meaningful and lasting reform through this Working Group.
First, we consider how to improve mandates at the system level.
We we need to learn the lessons from almost 20 years ago when a similar mandate exercise was conducted as were ultimately unsuccessful because it focused on reviewing individual mandates.
The sheer number of existing mandates means a mandate by mandate approach in this Working Group is simply not feasible in the time that we have available.
Second, the development and sharing of comprehensive information and analysis by the Secretariat, including but not limited to the online registry of mandates, will be crucial to help members of the Working Group understand how we might do better in drafting, implementing and evaluating mandates.
Third, we encourage this Working Group to focus on how we might collectively develop practical measures to reduce duplication, eliminate redundancies, link mandate decisions with projected costs, enhance efficiencies in implementation and and terminate mandates that we agree have become obsolete.
The upcoming Committee season is an opportunity to reflect on those issues and consider matters we could take forward in this Working Group.
Fourth, we note that some of the recommendations in the report are within the existing authorities and remit of the Secretary General.
We encourage the Secretary General to make full use of his authorities to action these recommendations as soon as possible and for this Working Group to focus on those issues that require approval or action by Member States.
Finally, we echo the call for strengthened monitoring and assessment of mandate implementation.
This is essential to ensure our commitments here in New York and other United nations fora translate into impact on the ground.
CAANS looks forward to working constructively with our fellow Working Group members on practical steps to strengthen the the capacity of the United nations to deliver its mandates.
Thank you very much.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the Permanent Representative of Australia speaking for Cairns.
I will shortly invite the Permanent Representative of the Solomon Islands speaking for the Pacific Island Forum to speak, but just to let you know, this is the last speaker, at least that we understand.
Speaking for a group if you are speaking for a group and you've not yet taken the floor, please do let the Secret Secretariat no Permanent Representative Solomon Islands Please go ahead.

**Solomon Islands | Permanent Representative | (PIF)**

Thank you very much.
Court Chairs, I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the Pacific Island Forum members, in short PITH who are based in New York.
We welcome the establishment of the Working Group.
We stress the importance of an open, transparent and inclusive process and welcome the assurances made by the Co Chairs in this regard.
We welcome the appointment of the two Co Chairs who include a PEAF member and a small island developing State member.
You have our full support.
We recognize the importance of all organizations, including the un, continuing to evolve and improve to better deliver for the people they serve.
Indeed, the PIF members are also currently undergoing their own reform of the Pacific regional architecture.
Co Chairs we know that most PIF members find the volume of the UN's work program to be highly demanding, especially given the size and the capacities of many PIF missions.
PIF members are therefore cautiously optimistic about the potential benefits to be achieved by improving how mandates are created, implemented and reviewed.
At the structural level, we stress the importance of ensuring that the Working Group gives appropriate attention to ensuring the UN achieves effectiveness and impact across all the three pillars of its peace and security, sustainable development and human rights.
We want to highlight the importance of the UN development system for the Pacific island countries in this regard.
We stress the importance of ensuring that UN remains active and engaged in the Pacific and retains an adequate and effective presence in the region through any reform efforts.
Co Chairs we welcome the Co Chairs proposed approach of beginning with a discovery phase followed by the production phase, which would help ensure meaningful opportunities for participation and engagement by small delegations.
Finally, we acknowledge that the question of mandates is very much one of the Member states, but welcomed the input of the Secretary General and his team in assisting members of the Working group with any data or analysis that they request.
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of the Solomon Islands.
And I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Romania.

**Romania | Representative**

Thank you very much.
Co Chairs in addition to the points made by the European Union, I would like to add a few of my own.
I want to offer my commiserations for this union.
Important role that you are assuming, and I see this role that you're exercising is a very laborious one, but also a role that actually encompasses many work streams of our approach to the United Nations.
I like very much where the journey started by the Secretary General in February this year is leading us.
This process is something that we have asked for, but as Member States to be in the driving seat.
We got what we have asked for.
And I think here we Member States, we have to accompany your important role.
We count on your leadership and we support it.
It's very much important.
But I think also for us, for Member States, it's a truth test.
We have to look ourselves in the mirror how we can create more efficiency and effectiveness through our work.
We've been going through some of the points together with Matu, our colleague from South Africa, in the revitalization process.
And actually this is one of important points as we are looking towards the Committee season, which is going to be very complicated.
I mean, providing many challenges that we heard from a number of delegations, small delegations, some challenges.
But I think we should also be looking at the opportunities that this committee season provides.
And first and foremost we have the, the path laid forward by the Secretary General on the first work stream.
And then we have these several efforts underway already in this session on the harmonizing, streamlining, harmonizing and avoiding duplications that result from the recently adopted revitalization resolution.
And of course we have the Secretary General Recommendation on stream 2, the report, which is very much important.
I think many, many delegations, many groups talked about that.
So we do see merits in opening up the Secretary General report for consultation among Member States.
I want to commend your call to Member States to contribute to all these efforts, to participate at the appropriate level, senior level, ambassador level, preferably wherever this is possible.
I think these discussions are very complex.
The timeline is very short, it is true, but I think we can get it done at the end of the day.
And what we can collectively do and not only place responsibility on the court Chairs is also for ourselves to look collectively at what could be the end result, what kind of outcome we are contemplating.
This is not something that will come out of the blue.
It's something that would be informed by discussions and deliberations in the past several months and also years.
Understanding the overarching objective I think is very much important, especially that we are talking about the 80th session.
It's an important benchmark in the history of the United nations and I think we all have a stake in it.
All in all, congratulations for agreeing to take up on this role, but commiserations and I think we all should be consider ourselves equally responsible in this process.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

Thank you.
I thank the distinguished representative of Romania and also thank him for keeping to the three minute timeline.
We do have a long list of speakers and we are encouraging everyone to be mindful of that as well.
With that, I give the floor to the distinguished representative of Switzerland.

**Switzerland | Representative**

Thank you Co Chair and I would like to start by joining colleagues and extending our warmest congratulations on your appointment as Co Chairs.
My country looks forward to working under your wise leadership and we thank the Secretary General for his comprehensive report and also USG Rider for presenting some of the aspects today as much as the pga.
And we welcome the progress made on the Mandate Registry which will provide Member States with much needed visibility across the system.
My country recalls that the work of the United nations is based on three interdependent pillars, as it was just also mentioned by our colleague from the Solomon Island.
This review therefore must strengthen all these pillars in a balanced manner and avoid treating them in isolation.
The review must also be the subject to constructive engagement by all Member States, each of which must be prepared to make concessions so that the UN's work is sustainable, effective and in line with available resources.
So our approach will be based on four principles.
First, combating duplication of must be a priority.
Mandates are an essential framework for UN action, but when they overlap they fragment the system and instead they should reinforce existing areas of expertise, for example in the fields of health, humanitarian action or human rights, where knowledge and capacity are already concentrated.
To this end, intra and institutional competition must be avoided and the core capacities of entities must be be adequately funded.
Second, build on what works the Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review.
The QCPR illustrates how Member States can provide policy guidance without reopening individual mandates.
The resulting reform of the United nations development System proves that clear guidance can realign the system and produce results.
Similarly, functional support services should be consolidated, shared and strengthened by not dismantled.
The measures envisaged must aim for long term efficiency and be based on sound cost benefit analysis.
Third, mandates must be forward looking.
They must be clear, coherent and adequately resourced to be credible and effective, but they must also anticipate tomorrow's challenges and benefit from technological advances and the interaction between science and diplomacy.
Fourth, the responsibility of Member States Ultimately, it is up to us to ensure the coherence of the system in the General assembly as well as in the governing bodies of the specialized agencies.
While fully respecting their autonomy, we must act coherently in all the bodies in which we participate.
This also means that the review must go beyond the Secretariat alone and cover the entire United nations system.
We have a unique opportunity to rethink and strengthen the system.
Switzerland is ready to work constructively with all delegations to ensure that this review brings about concrete improvements.
Switzerland is determined to continue to offer the full support of Geneva, a place of inclusiveness, innovation, digital development and scientific foresight that will increase the effectiveness of the United nations as a whole.
I thank you,

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Switzerland and I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Argentina.

**Argentina | Representative**

Good morning, colleagues, Distinguished Co Chairs, PGA Under Secretary Ryder in addition to the statement delivered by the Xi77 and China, the Argentine delegation expresses the following on its national capacity, the UN 80 initiative represents an opportunity to evaluate the overall functioning of the organization and seek convergences to promote more efficient and effective functioning of the United nations system while optimizing the fulfillment of the mandates.
Eight years after its creation, we must remember that the organization was established with the objective of preserving international peace and security, resolving disputes among its members and defending the freedom and rights of individuals.
Therefore, we must focus in the principles of the Charter and thus reassess the role of the institution recognized by society as a forum for the peaceful resolution between states.
We must also make accurate and realistic diagnosis and recognized that in recent years certain agendas had been oversized, generating inefficiencies and distancing the work of the UN from its original mandates.
Peace, security and development.
We recognize the role of the Member States, based on their sovereign powers, in providing political guidelines to the UN system among and supervising its work, and the role of the Secretary General as a Chief Administrative officer in promoting the necessary administrative reforms.
The UN 80 also represents an opportunity to have a more efficient UN system and the management of administrative and financial resources, reducing expenses and eliminating overlapping functions.
In this exercise, we must assume shared responsibility between Member States and the UN system for the proliferation of certain mandates, but also for the proliferation of parallel initiatives, meetings and agendas that, without an intergovernmental mandate, lead to an oversizing and duplication of certain agendas and debates.
Co Chairs we must take into account existing debates and formal spaces.
For example, the recent process of revitalizing the working methods of the General Assembly.
The UN 80 initiative is structural and comprehensive and we therefore await the result of the 2026 budget review and the World Stream 3 report.
The review of mandates is a very important and sensitive issue and therefore must be addressed prudently and specifically without resorting the general approaches of principles.
Under the one size fits all concept.
Regarding the work of this other group, we consider it necessary to to have a predictable roadmap for the coming months, avoiding overlaps with the key moment of the Committee's work, especially for small and medium sized delegation and generate, as you said, quality dial IO.
Additionally, and as a preliminary idea, we wish to preserve the General Rule that General assembly resolutions remain valid until they are fully implemented and not be undermined by sunset clause.
Finally, the Group the Working Group could follow the methodology of the Secretary General's report organized into three stages, mandate creation, mandate execution and mandate review.
The Group could focus its work on the first two stages and in this initial phase, considering the third stage requires a more comprehensive approach in time.
Thank you so much.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Argentina and now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Bangladesh.

**Bangladesh | Representative**

Thank you. Co Chair Let me begin by thanking both of you for convening this meeting.
Bangladesh welcomes the Secretary General's UN Initiative Unit Initiative as a timely and necessary step forward revitalizing the UN Development system.
We believe this reform process should aim at enhancing the effectiveness, efficiency and responsiveness of the event system.
This is a moment to make the event more purpose driven, more inclusive and more accountable those who serve.
However, the reform process must retain a clear focus on those left farthest behind the events.
Development system must continue to provide solutions for protracted humanitarian and political crises around the world.
Reforms must now translate into measures that cut necessary resources to the UN offices that support countries in special situations.
Peacekeeping, peace building, climate resilience and sustainable development must remain our core priorities with the provision of adequate resources to fulfill mandates and to sustain effectiveness.
Co Chairs, the reform process must be guided by the principles of objectivity, universality and impartiality, ensuring that priorities are based on genuine needs and not influenced by discrimination and selectivity.
I thank you Co Chairs for convening this meeting.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Bangladesh and now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Paraguay.

**Paraguay | Representative**

Co Chairs, Madame pga, First allow me to congratulate you both, Caroline Schwarzer, Permanent Representative of New Zealand, and Brian Wallace, of course Permanent Representative of Jamaica, on your appointment as a Co Chair of this Hard Working Group, Paraguay welcomes your first meeting and extend its support to the process and to you co facilitators.
We echo the sentiment expressed by the G77 in China and would like to add a few comments in our national capacity.
As we have mentioned on previous occasions, Paraguay supports any initiative aimed to improving the operational efficiency of the United nations system and emphasizes its firm's position on strengthening the development pillar as a part of this effort to create a more efficient organization.
We also stress the need for the establishment and work plan of the hard Working Group to be organized with sufficient flexibility, considering that the main part of the General assembly session consists with the intense workload in the Plenary and its six main committees which will allow for the effective participation of all delegation, including small ones.
With regards to the organization of the work, we suggest a sequence that move from the general to specific.
First clarify common objectives, then address technical or sectorial issues and finally agree on concrete recommendations.
We also believe it's important to identify specific expect objectives from the outset.
The roadmap that the PGA just mentioned will be crucial so that the debate does not remain purely conceptual.
We consider the work carried out by the Secretariat to review the implementation of mandate to be important in this regards.
The results of this analysis could be of vital assistance to our review work, for which we will require an efficient schedule that does not conflict with the task of the committees that will begin shortly, especially for small delegations like ours and many others.
In this regard, we trust that the CO facilitator will be able to guide us toward the achievement of this objective with due diligence.
And finally, we reiterate CO facilitators our support for the use of technology during this review process.
Such artificial intelligence, given that it can accelerate the analysis of information, identify redundancies and propose synergies based on evidence, thus contributing to more informed and transparent decisions.
Thank you both.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Paraguay.
I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Zambia.

**Zambia | Representative**

Thank you very much, Excellencies, Co Chairs Adornset.
Allow me to congratulate the both of you Co Chairs on your appointment to lead this Working Group.
I'd like to assure you that of Zambia's support, Zambia aligns with the statement statements delivered by the group of 77, China, the small States Group and the Africa Group and would like to make the following remarks in our national capacity.
Zambia recognizes the urgent need to streamline mandates to alleviate the unnecessary administrative burdens on the un.
We should take note that the effectiveness of any reform must enhance the organization's responsiveness to their diverse priorities and pressing needs of Member States and the populations we serve.
I do want to underline here that we must preserve the comparative advantage of the United nations, which makes it a very unique institution given the constraints on collective time and resources, especially during this main part of the session.
The program of work to be adopted should allow for substantive discussions and consultations with Member States to ensure that all the voices of Member States are heard while taking into consideration the business schedule of committees and delegations.
Further, we recognize that the mandate of this working this Ad hoc Working Group focuses on Work Stream 2 and as stated by others, it's important to review how this mandate relates to other work streams to ensure that there's no duplication with regard to the organization's work and sequence of discussion.
Zambia recommends that the Adult Working Committee clearly outlines how the process the review process will be conducted, including whether a preliminary report will be shared with Member States prior to its submission to the General Assembly.
Informal consultations should be designed to allow for delegation sufficient time to provide input before any zero outcome document is presented.
Additionally, there must be clarity on how the Ad Hoc Working Committee will coordinate with other UN Committees as stated, especially since these bodies will continue to deliberate and issue mandates concurrently.
It is essential to define how these new mandates will interact with the ongoing work of the Ad Hoc Committee.
On the last point, with regard to the Working Group you know most effectively addressed the matters relating to the Secretary General's Mandate Implementation Review Report.
Zambia notes that the SG's report on mandate implementation focuses on the full cycle of mandates to identify systemic challenges affecting the US UN's effectiveness and agility.
In this context, it is important for the Ad Hoc Working Group to clearly define the scope of this review and specifically here we see clarity on whether the Committee will limit itself to the mandates of the General assembly or it include other mandates other resolutions such as ECOSOC and the Security Council.
In conclusion, I wish to assure you of Zambia's commitment to actively and constructively participate in the discussions of the informal and Ad hoc Working Group and the Mandate Implementation Review.
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Zambia.
I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of China, Cortez.

**China | Representative**

All protocols are observed.
China aligns itself with the statement by Iraq on behalf of the G77 and China.
This unity reform offered the UN an opportunity for self renewal by enhancing its governance capacity and better adapting to the evolving circumstances.
We would like to offer five suggestions.
First, we must remain true to the founding mission at a Time when multilateralism and the UN are under severe strain, it is more important than ever to recall the spirit that brought nations together 80 years ago.
China believes that the reform must revitalize the UN authority and vitality, safeguard the purpose and principles of the UN Charter, enable the organization to keep pace with the times and ensure that it will continue to play a central role in international affairs and make greater contributions to the for the world peace and development.
Second, we must strive for real results with high efficiency.
China believes that the reform should focus on improving the quality and efficiency of the UN's work, as well as its agility, responsiveness and the resilience of this organization.
In this process, wasteful spending, redundant formalities and excessive bureaucracy, more must be avoided.
As Member States, we are all familiar with the burden of too many meetings and too many documents, and I believe there is a broader consensus on the need for change.
The Working Group may start from this aspect to deliver visible improvements at early dates.
Third, we must stay action oriented.
This Working Group was established by the GA to improve the creation, delivery and review of the mandates by identifying principles and follow up actions.
As essential as they are, principles alone cannot be enough.
They must be matched with concrete, actionable measures.
Only then can the reform be truly implemented with tangible results.
Therefore, we believe that when discussing relevant principles, the Working Group should also design supporting implementation measures.
This will ensure that the UN makes real steps and deliver real outcomes, thereby winning the future through real achievements.
Fourth, we must strengthen research and analysis.
The mandates of the Secretariat comes out of the nearly 4,000 resolutions and other resources.
The sheer scale and complexity make it very difficult for Member States to see all the details.
We believe that the Secretariat can do more.
It should build on the Secretary General's reports and recommendations, summarize past lessons and put forward practical proposals for the Working Group.
At the same time, the Co Chairs should heed the views of the broader UN membership to foster cooperation, build consensus and seek solidarity through consultation so that the work of this group can stand the test of history.
Fifth, we must make a balanced approach to the three pillars.
The GA resolution makes it very clear that the reform should ensure effective and efficient mandate delivery across all three pillars, namely peace and security, development and human rights of the United Nations.
Let me conclude by reaffirming that China will continue to work together with all Member States and the Secretariat to improve the work of the UN and steer the global governance system toward a more justable and equitable direction.
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of China.
I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of the United States.

**United States | Representative**

Thank you, Ambassador Wallace. Ambassador Schwager, congratulations on your appointment as the co chairs of the informal ad hoc working group.
We look forward to working you with both of you in this capacity.
In particular, over the coming months we will need to identify an ambitious set of principles and follow up actions to improve the creation, delivery and review of mandates.
The United nations was established to resolve the most pressing international challenges.
The mandates we provide this organization should reflect the seriousness of that purpose.
They should be clear, concise, targeted and have tangible results.
The ad hoc working group should result in better prioritization, greater impact and elimination of duplication across the work of the the United Nations.
The Secretary General's report on the review of mandate implementation identifies numerous proposals for consideration by Member States.
Shorter mandates, prioritization within mandates, flexibility to align resources, inclusion of expiration clauses, reviews of mandates, streamlining agendas and programs of work across different organs, among others.
These recommendations are concrete and practical and many of them are not new.
The General assembly just adopted the latest resolution on the revitalization of its work which quote, strongly encourages Member States to reduce the frequency, length and number of resolutions and to only reintroduce resolutions when operational adjustments are being made.
Language that was unfortunately watered down during negotiations and it includes language, sorry.
And language on the establishment of sunset clauses did not make it into the final text.
We hope that in the spirit of UN80, this ad hoc working group will build on and strengthen such proposals.
Our success depends on our collective willingness for reform.
In parallel, we encourage the Secretary General to move quickly to implement the recommendations in his report that he can take under his own authority.
And we thank Under Secretary General Guy Ryder for his remarks and information in that regard.
Thank you very much.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of the United States and give the floor to the distinguished representative of Indonesia.

**Indonesia | Representative**

Thank you, Excellency.
Let me join others to congratulate you and also the Permanent Representative of New Zealand on your assumption of duties as Co chairs of this informal adult working group.
Indonesia also welcomes this first meeting of the Working Group as a chance to shape priorities and deliver progress to this task.
Allow me to highlight three key priorities of our delegation.
First, Indonesia stress the need to draw lessons from the past similar processes.
Let's ensure that our future work must be efficient and well targeted.
Second, we believe that open and inclusive approaches are fundamental to ensure broad participation from Member States, including in their national capacity or in the form of groupings.
Third, we need to ensure that the process will align with other relevant parallel processes to avoid Duplication in particular this include the GA revitalization, ICOSOC reform, as well as the discussion on the reform of the Security Council.
Excellency, we need outcomes that make a difference, not just more paper.
In this regard, we also would like to ask a question to the how do the coaches envision the final product of this exercise?
The information is crucial to help delegations calibrate their efforts and to contribute to the discussion so that we can focus on delivering tangible results.
Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, we share the Co Chair's view that the task is demanding, but it's not impossible.
So let's continue keeping the process open, inclusive and focused to turn limited time into meaningful progress.
Indonesia stands ready to contribute to that spirit.
Thank you.

I thank the distinguished representative of Indonesia.
I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of El Salvador.

**El Salvador | Permanent Representative**

Gracias. Dear Co Chairs, Excellencies El Salvador and Ecuador warmly welcome the leadership of New Zealand and Jamaican Co Chair.
In this process, you can count on our full support and constructive engagement.
Our delegations Besides aligning to the G77 statement, we would like to highlight the following.
First, BSG's recent report on the review and mandate implementation underscored China challenges that Member States know too well.
The proliferation of meetings, increasingly lengthy reports, duplication of work across entities and the fragmented financing.
These are not abstract concerns.
They directly undermine the organization effectiveness and also the credibility.
This points to an urgent need to rationalize the agenda and discussions on bienalization, tranalization or or the creation of new items cannot remain side notes to working methods debates that repeatedly are deferred to action.
And in this sense, in this Working Group, we Member States must demonstrate not only the willingness but the political will to improve the functioning of organization.
And that also means refraining from tabling resolutions or initiatives that add volume without impact or outcomes without action.
So I take this opportunity also to make that call and that we must be serious, disciplined and ready to do our part.
Even changes that may appear modest or minimum can definitely generate a transformative impact.
So, Co Chairs, let me also be clear.
None of this is near the other working group revitalization.
Most recent resolutions provide some expectations and they give us some guidance on this.
So the UNAID initiative must now build on these commitments and not reinvent them.
And in that regards, we urge you Co Chairs to structure this group's work holistically, drawing, as many other colleagues have mentioned before, drawing from lessons from past processes, but also ensuring applicability across the organization's principals and subsidiary bodies.
So in other words, our task is not to reinvigorate the wheel, but to make it run faster and more effectively.
We also call for realism in scheduling.
The heavy workload of the last quarter of the year restrains all delegation, particularly small ones as Ecuador and El Salvador.
So the proliferation of processes definitely undermines inclusivity and meaningful participation.
So timelines must reflect this reality.
Furthermore, clarity will be needed on how upcoming mandates and agreements emerging from the main committees will feed into the UNAD process.
Therefore, close coordination with committee chairs will be crucial.
And finally, this initiative must be forward looking.
Innovation should guide both the consultations and the proposals.
And we believe the future of the UN depends not only, as I mentioned before, on political will, but also on its capacity to adapt and modernize.
Nevertheless, Member States should carefully consider and study those proposals related to the potential use of new tools, including AI, to ensure that they are responsibly but also effectively used in this process.
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the Permanent Representative of El Salvador.
And I now give the floor to the Permanent Representative of Ecuador.

**Ecuador | Permanent Representative**

Thank you, Co Chairs.
I was distracted because I was congratulated my neighbor for her excellent statement on behalf of El Salvador, Salvador and Ecuador, of course.
So with this in mind, I just a few comments to add in my national capacity.
But based on your opening remarks, Co Chairs, I would be remiss not to offer you from the outset the support of my delegation.
This also goes to the PGA and Elena Burbuk and the Secretary as Representative Guy.
Basically what I'm speaking about is helping this organization to overcome its deficiencies.
Particularly because this exercise, as we have heard, coincides with a moment that is not only historic but highly challenging.
Contrary to the spirit of San Francisco.
The challenges of our times go to the very realm multilateralism, which is being questioned often with good reasons.
Therefore, the UNAD initiative should be another instrument to strengthen the capacity to respond to today's global challenges to deliver tangible results to our peoples.
I have no doubt that your proved leadership Co Chairs will succeed in contributing to have a stronger, more multilateralism led by the United nations, with sound and realistic mandates on peace and security, development and human rights.
To conclude, we are ready to engage at the political level as you have asked us because particularly smaller delegations such as mine are ready to to be in the table.
Thank you very much.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the Permanent representative of Ecuador.
And I now give the floor to the representative of Brazil.

**Brazil | Representative**

Thank you, Madam Co Chair.
Dear Co Chairs, USG Rider Dear Co Chairs, I join others in congratulating you on your appointment as school FACILITATORS of this Working Group and as usual, you can count on my delegation support.
My delegation aligns itself with a statement delivered by the Chair of the group of 77 in China and adds the following brief comments as we launch the activities of the working group on Workstream 2, it is of utmost importance to keep in mind that time is the scarcest resource we have.
Its efficient use is critical.
The constraints of initiating an ambitious task in parallel to the Main Committee's main session are not to be underestimated.
We suggest dedicating these initial months to listening and reflecting before devising the shape and content of any outputs which could be left for a second moment, namely after the December progress report.
Ensuring open and inclusive participation in these discussions, including those of smaller delegations, is key to ensuring a smooth Member State driven process.
A very careful scheduling of activities of the Working Group is likely the most effective ways to ensure inclusivity.
As many others have indicated, it is key to learn from the previous exercise of mandate review and avoid strenuous efforts that could only lead to a repetition of the limited results then achieved.
The recommendations from the Secretary General's report provide valuable initial input for our work.
As we begin to think ways to consider those recommendations, we suggest to focus on discussions that could enable legislative bodies to better design and review mandates that seems more effective and viable than emphasizing a backward looking approach.
Mandate creation, delivery and review should not be viewed as a concentrated exercise taking place once every few years or decades.
These tasks are matters that deserve continuous attention by Member States in all mandate generating bodies.
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the representative of Brazil.
I'm now going to invite the representative of France then to be followed by the Russian Federation and Algiers, France.
The floor is yours,

**France | Representative**

Madame et Monsieur les Cote President et Monsieur le Secretaire General Adjoin.
I will make some short remarks in English and French and the complete text will be made available in both languages, but first in French Je suis addresser me felicitation au de cotent du grop de travail, I recall in English, will call for a full involvement of all Member States to the process, which will be made possible especially by attention drawn on multilingualism.
France, alongside its European Union partners, reaffirms its unwavering support for the ongoing transformation efforts aimed at enhancing the effectiveness, efficiency and impact on the ground of United nations action.
Constructive collective.
Development pay security.
Concrete.
We call for this Working Group to serve as a space for constructive and collective reflection with a view to achieving tangible outcomes across the three pillars of the United nations human rights development and peace and security.
We must seize the opportunity for the coming months of the coming months to first, establish a sound and rigorous assessment of the current landscape with the support of a Secretariat.
Particular attention should be given to a more detailed identification and documentation of overlaps and duplications in the implementation of certain mandates.
Second, reach consensus and concrete proposals concerning the full life cycle of a mandate, from its creation to its implementation, ultimately its evaluation.
In this regard, the proposals and recommendations contained in the Secretary General's report offer an excellent foundation for work.
You can count both of you and the Secretariat on France's strong support and full engagement to help ensure the success of this essential work.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the representative of France and I now give the floor to the Russian Federation to be followed by Algeria and Thailand.
Russia, the floor is yours.

**Russian Federation | Representative**

Thank you very much.
Dear Co Chairs, I also congratulate you upon your assignment and I also greet Excellency Guy Ryder who is with us.
I would like to say that we welcome the Co Chairs emphasis on inclusivity.
We also wish you all the best efforts to make the discussions constructive and down to business.
I think this Working Group might benefit from being very pragmatic and discussing the ideas and the language that we are expected to put forward.
I agree with all those speakers and support the focus on consensus basis.
That should be guidance for us in our work.
And as far as organization and sequence of the Working Group's work, we are suggesting step by step approach.
By this we mean that we need to address least controversial issues in the report of the ESG and find the issues that everyone has no objections against and put forward them as our recommendations.
And then we can move on to discuss to more sensitive areas which we have divergent views and which will take more time to elaborate our recommendations.
I should also say that the Secretary General report is providing a number of recommendations both to be implemented by the Secretary General and to be considered by the General Assembly.
I would like to note that the resolution of the GA which is establishing the Working Group is not differentiating the proposals, it is talking about all the proposals.
Because for example, my delegation is not seeing all the recommendations as marked by SG own prerogative to be this own prerogative.
I think all recommendations deserve our dialogue, our considerations.
We found that a lot of recommendations put forward by the Secretary General are very constructive, very wise and very beneficial for the future of the UN.
Yet we have to recognize that it is not 100% recommendations.
Russian delegation is agreeing, including some of them which are marked as Secretary General Prerogative I think some of them deserve consideration by the Member States.
So I think that this would also be in support of a lot of delegations who spoke to the end of the Member States driven process.
We fully also support this working group and this work is Member States driven process, and we're happy to move on to suggest a timetable.
We understand that you will have to juggle a lot of meetings of the main committees and we assure you of our utmost support and constructive engagement.
Thank you very much.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the Russian Federation for their remarks and I now give the floor to the representative of Algeria, to be followed by Thailand and then Pakistan.
Algeria, the floor is yours.

**Algeria | Representative**

As a firm advocate of multilingualism, my delegation deeply regrets the absence of translation to this meeting.
Excellencies Co Chairs as an opening note, allow me to congratulate you on your appointment as Co Chairs of this important process.
My delegation aligns itself with a statement delivered by G77 in China and the African Group, and I would like to add a few remarks on my national capacity.
Algeria attaches great importance to the UNHCG initiative, which offers a timely opportunity to strengthen the effectiveness of the United nations across its three pillars, not merely as a response to budgetary constraints, but because after eight decades, our organization must evolve into a version that is both up to date and efficient, worthy of the trust placed in it by the people of the world.
This work must remain member state driven and consensus based, as the organization's legitimacy rests on its intergovernmental nature and the sovereign equality of all its members.
Any review of mandates should therefore reflect the shared priorities of the membership and respect their sovereign rights equally.
This process must be firmly rooted in the Charter of the United nations and in the established rules of procedure of the General Assembly.
These are not mere formalities.
They are the compass ensuring fairness, inclusivity and transparency.
At the same time, refunds should not become an exercise in paperwork, but a means of lightening the weight that too often slows our organization and threatens the credibility of multilateralism.
By reducing unnecessary burdens, we enable the United nations to channel its energy into concrete results.
To succeed, we must be not only rigorous, but also creative and innovative, drawing on ideas from across the membership and not solely from SG reports.
In this sense, work stream 2 on mandate implementation Review must also speak to the aspirations expressed in the two other work streams.
Reform cannot be fragmented.
It must instead weave together these trends in synergy.
Finally, Algeria believes that the work of this ad hoc working group should proceed in phases that allow adequate time for meaningful and effective Participation by all delegations.
In conclusion, Algeria reaffirms its readiness to engage constructively.
I thank you,

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the representative of Algeria and I now give the floor to the representative of Thailand, our permanent representative of Thailand, to be followed by Pakistan and Lichtenstein.
Thailand, the floor is yours.

**Thailand | Representative**

Thank you.
Kochai.
Congratulations to both of you on this very important appointment and thank you so much for convening this meeting.
Thailand alliance itself with statements delivered by Iraq on behalf of GS Vincent China and I wish to deliver this statement from our national capacity.
Mandates are the property and responsibility of Member States.
It is up to us to decide when mandates should be created, which mandates are still relevant and of course which mandates have become obsolete.
The Secretary General has provide a thoughtful and data driven proposals.
But of course the choices and the political will lie with us.
This group has only six months to deliver recommendations.
Given this short time frame, you must be pragmatic and focus on what is feasible and doable from the SDA report.
One useful approach perhaps could be to identify a set of quick wins, practical measures that can be agreed upon early, such as streamlining reports and resolutions or piloting sunset clauses.
These measures could be of course introduced on a trial basis before deciding on more ambitious reforms.
Many of the six generous proposals, digital registry, self mandates, charter and clearance resolutions, streamlined reports and meetings, expiry clauses to avoid man that's continuing indefinitely and stronger accountability for results are all practical measures that could reduce duplications, free up resources and strengthen the UN's impact.
But let us also be absolutely honest.
Reform will not succeed if it is directed only at the Secretariat.
We, the Member States, must also change our own working methods.
We are the ones who adopt more and more resolutions, who request more reports, who create overlapping mandates and who too often instruct the UN to deliver within existing resources.
These habits have made the UN larger, more complex and at times less efficient.
The 80th anniversary of the UN is an important chance to strengthen multilateralism and show our taxpayers that this organization can adapt, deliver and remain relevant to the challenges of today and tomorrow.
To conclude, it is our responsibility to make the UN stronger and adaptable with changing times.
Thailand stand ready to work with our delegations so that we can hand over a more coherent, effective and trusted UN for generations to come.
Thank you very much for your kind attention.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the Permanent Representative of the Thailand.
And I now give the floor to the Permanent Representative of Pakistan, to be followed by Lichtenstein and India.
The floor is yours.

**Pakistan | Permanent Representative**

Thank you.

**Pakistan | Representative**

Big congrats, coaches on assuming this important Responsibility.
We would also like to align with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of the group of 77 and China and and coaches.
In response to your guiding questions, I would like to offer the following suggestions.
One, Our delegation could be flexible with the convening of one meeting per month for the remainder of this year, which should not clash with main Committee meetings.
Substantive negotiations, in our view, should commence in the next year.
Two, these meetings could be thematic dialogues, each focused on one of the three aspects of the SG's report.
Third, all three work streams are interlinked, particularly work streams two and three.
However, we would not be in favor of considering any proposals emanating from work stream three in this Working Group unless the timeframe of the Working Group is reconsidered.
We also reiterate our request for a comprehensive report on the UNAT initiative at the earliest to ensure a better understanding of the purpose of this exercise and also to ensure coherence of our action.
Fourthly, the process from its outset must have transparent and inclusive modalities.
Specifically, we request that all written submissions received by the co facilitators be uploaded on a dedicated website and at the same time, actions taken by the Secretary General should also be shared with Member States.
Fifth, any decision or recommendation impacting existing mandates, particularly politically sensitive ones on which the concerned countries have reservations, should not be adopted until consensus is achieved and their concerns are adequately addressed.
As you also noted, the clear directive of the assembly to strive for consensus on the question of how to approach the exercise.
We believe that the proposed thematic dialogues must be accompanied with robust data and briefings by the Secretariat.
Preliminarily, the Secretariat should provide a detailed and interactive briefing on the Mandate Registry, including an update on its status and methodology, should inform Member States about the implementation status of each mandate contained in the Registry and should undertake further work and analysis to identify actual duplications coaches.
In conclusion, we believe this informal Working Group should negotiate a short resolution encouraging Member States to undertake steps that may help achieve the goals underlined in the SG's report recommendations.
Our full statement is being submitted in writing.
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Pakistan.
I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Liechtenstein and following my co Chair's example, India will be next, followed by Portugal.
Liechtensteinstein, you have the floor.
Thank you.
Thank you.

**Liechtenstein | Representative**

Co Chairs, all protocol observed.
And we thank the President for her leadership in setting up this ad hoc Working Group.
And we thank you for your willingness to guide us through this important and difficult process.
It sounds like a very technical discussion, but at the end, of course, it is a very political one.
We're talking about the future of our organization, and we want to see a process at the end of which this organization comes out leaner, stronger, and more productive and focused on all three pillars of the work of the UN Equally.
I think it's important to emphasize that failure here cannot be an option.
And that's the one opportunity that we have to put the organization on the foundation that it needs to be successful in the next.
In the next decades.
We also believe that High Level Week is very, very important for us to put this on the agenda of our principles where it has not, I think, arrived in all cases.
I hope we will use the opportunities that we have and that we will also have many of our leaders actually address this in their speeches in the general debate.
On your guiding questions that I find very helpful on how to.
How to organize our discussions as productively and constructively as possible.
We do believe early scheduling is very helpful.
We also believe that what you have done for today is extremely helpful, namely give us guiding questions.
And then, of course, it's up to us to take them up and to.
And to respond to them.
We do, of course, share the sensitivities that others have mentioned with respect to the capabilities of small states.
We are one of the smallest members of the United Nations.
At the same time, I do hope that all of us, and I think all of us also at the level of PRs, are committed to this process and to dedicate the time that will be necessary to make this success.
I think the reality of our calendars is, is that there is almost no date that does not have a meeting of a main committee.
So we would encourage you to choose dates that are taken up with more routine work in the committees where we typically are not present as PRs or not automatically.
And we also encourage you to have a combination of very informal conversations outside of the setting that we find ourselves in today, but also meet here regularly so everybody is on the same page and inclusivity and transparency is fully guaranteed.
So we're certainly committed, and I am committed personally to attending these meetings and to working with your guidance.
On the last question, of course, and others have said that before.
We have tried this before and we have not done very well.
So the first lesson for us certainly is that we should do it differently than we have done it in the past and really focus on the fact that this is a mandate implementation review report that, in our view, must, you know, be focused on and be founded on having agreed parameters for beginning reviewing internal terminating of mandates and that we can apply these principles then accordingly and turn them into the action that we are all looking for and that we will actually really be needing.
There are three work streams.
For us it's very clear that your mandate is Work Stream 2 and for us it is also very, very clear that the success, the atmosphere and the outcomes of this process will be decisive for the success that we can have in the other work streams.
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Liechtenstein.
I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of India, to be followed by Portugal.

**India | Representative**

Thank you.
Mr. Cocchia, let me begin by congratulating you and and the Permanent Representative of New Zealand on your appointment as Co Chairs of the informal Ad Hoc Working Group India aligns with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of G7 China.
Allow me to make following additional points in my national capacity.
First, for the UNAT to be effective and impactful, it needs to be recognized that all three work streams are interlinked and therefore the scope of the Ad hoc Working Group should cover the entire life cycle of mandates, including creation, delivery and review across all three work streams.
Second, scope of the Working Group must cover all mandates emanating from General Assembly, Security Council, ECOSOC and Human Rights Council.
Third, strengthening the effectiveness and impact of the Development Plan should be accorded top priority under unat.
Further, under the Development Pillar, specialized knowledge and expertise of UN entities which cater to specific context and developmental needs of countries in the Global south must be preserved.
Fourth, taking into consideration the lesson learned of the past review processes, it is important that the Working Group should focus on principles rather than look into the merit of individual mandates.
In addition to the inclusive trust, transparent and intergovernmental nature of negotiations under unat, the work stream too should be guided by broad principles such as reducing the periodicity of reports, mechanisms and processes incorporating sunset clause while creating and renewing mandates undertaking mandate review by utilizing AI tools with focus on the impact of mandate implementation and avoiding duplication between implementing entities.
Fifth, we encourage adoption of a flexible program of work of the Working Group that allows for meaningful and widest possible participation of Member State during the main segment of the 80th session.
On the way forward, Mr. Kochi, the Secretary can provide an early presentation on the lesson learned from the previous mandate review exercise and consider developing necessary AI tools to identify duplication and carry out mandate review process across the mandate landscape.
The CO Chairs may wish to share their Working Work Plan take into consideration the intensive agenda of the main Committees ahead.
In conclusion, Mr. Co Chair India stand ready to engage constructively and support the Co Chairs in this process.
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of India.
I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Portugal, to be followed by Mexico and then the United Kingdom.

**Portugal | Representative**

I would like to start by congratulating Jamaica and New Zealand on their appointment as Co Chairs of this informal group which is fundamental for the future of our organization.
Portugal aligns itself with the statement delivered by the European Union.
Allow me to add some remarks in our national capacity.
As we all are aware, the different layers of change motivated by the UN Initiative offer us a unique opportunity to strengthen the United Nations.
The in depth analysis of the creation, delivery and review of mandates is central to this effort.
For Portugal, a more coherent and predictable mandate cycle supported by clear guiding principles is essential to enhance the credibility and effectiveness of the organization.
We are convinced that mandates should be crafted with stronger results, orientation, informed by evidence and aligned with the resources available.
A more systematic review mechanism and a set of guiding principles would also help us identify what works, what needs adjustment and how to ensure continuity when mandates evolve or over time.
In this regard, the role of the Secretariat will be critical during this process in providing the necessary expertise, analysis and lessons learned.
This discussion is also linked to the challenges ahead relating to work stream one.
We must be clear.
Efficiency gains cannot be a substitute for adequate resources, but they can and must help us to deliver better with what we have.
Portugal believes that the work streams 1 and 2 mutually reinforce efficiency in UN functioning and are a precondition for effective mandates and sound mandates are the foundation for efficiency in delivery.
It is also important to address the broader budgetary context.
The revised SEMAT is for the the 26 budget exercise this year with singular characteristics underscore the difficult balance between ambition and affordability.
Portugal is ready to engage constructively in discussions and how to ensure that mandates are both impactful and realistically resourced so that expectations and implementation remain aligned.
Mr. Cocher, Portugal stands ready to work with all delegations to ensure that this process delivers tangible improvements.
More than ever, Member States should try to be flexible during the negotiation process and show solidarity with the UN principles.
Let us make the UN initiative a turning point that strengths multilateralism equips the United nations to face the challenges ahead and better deliver to the people it serves.
Thank you very much.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Portugal.
I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Mexico and then the United Kingdom.

**Mexico | Representative**

Mr. Ryder, distinguished CO Chairs from New Zealand and Jamaica, allow me to extend my congratulations on your appointment to lead the efforts of this working group.
Mandates guide our collective action.
Reviewing them with both prudence and boldness is an imperative.
We cannot overlook.
The magnitude of this challenge calls for vision and statesmanship.
Mexico aspires for the mandate's review to be pragmatic, inclusive and grounded in consensus.
A systemic approach is essential if we are to overcome fragmentation and strengthen the coherence of the organization's actions.
Allow me to share a number of considerations that Mexico deems relevant for the process ahead, taking into consideration the three guiding questions provided this process must reinforce the UN's leadership across its three fundamental peace and security, development and human rights, while safeguarding the balance among them and consistently guided by the purposes of and principles enshrined in the Charter of the un.
The mandates review should enhance coherence across the whole entire UN system, including mandates that go beyond the scope of the Secretariat for funds, programs, specialized agencies and other entities.
It will be essential to promote dialogue within their respective governing bodies and to replicate this process across locations and levels of the system in order to prevent fragmentation and duplication.
The review of mandates must be understood as a core element of a broader, comprehensive and ambitious reform, not as an isolated or gradual technical exercise.
The goal is to transform the organization into a more effective, legitimate and results driven instrument.
On the ground, the process must be guided by a clear and streamlined methodology underpinned by a forward looking vision that anticipates and avoids costly adjustments.
It will be essential to design and implement targeted, systematic evaluation mechanisms that allow us to assess the relevance, validity and need of mandates, including, where appropriate, recommendations for determination in view of their fulfillment of solacence or redundancy.
Adjustments to the periodicity of reviews, for instance, shifting from annual to biennial or triennial cycles, should also be considered to ensure a coherent, orderly and sustainable process over time.
And the process must aim to deliver tangible, high impact results supported by efficient working methods, clear timelines and periodic evaluation mechanisms.
The process must be guided by pragmatism, inclusiveness and openness, with transparency and legitimacy ensuring a collective sense of ownership and finally, an active role for the Secretariat.
The Secretariat must play a proactive role by providing timely, relevant information and specialized technical support to the Working Group.
This will be key to fostering a solid, well informed and effective deliberative process and to achieve concrete and implementable results.
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Mexico.
I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of the United Kingdom, to be followed by Norway.

**United Kingdom | Representative**

The UK welcomes the appointment of the CO Chairs for this ad hoc working group and thanks them for their efforts to date and in advance for the hard work that is to come.
Given the short duration for this Working Group, we need to be focused on what we want to collectively achieve and in that regard, appreciate what Ambassador Wallace noted about the importance of an inclusive and transparent approach.
To that I would add the value of evidence and so welcome the fact that there will be a discovery phase at the start of this process.
From a UK perspective, we think it would be helpful for this Working Group to focus on the following three areas.
First, we should develop a set of principles for the preparation of future mandates.
The Secretary General set out a number of these in his report, such as the Secretariat providing more information in advance of any negotiation and increased budget transparency, both of which we would support in principle.
The UK would also support shorter texts with fewer meetings and reports, commissioned and more comprehensive review clauses.
And we welcome and appreciate USG Rider's update on these issues as well.
Second, we should develop a common framework for how we will organize our work.
We need to ensure we have clear parameters for how we review the implementation of the thousands of mandates we face as we go forward.
With support from the Secretariat and using the new UN Mandate Source Registry, we should categorize mandates according to which of the UN's three pillars they support, their authorizing bodies and their funding modalities, and consider these factors in how we take our work forward.
Third, it is essential that the Working Group makes tangible early progress on reviewing areas of duplication and unhelpful overlap.
As a starting point, we we should request the Secretariat to provide information on the wealth of reports that are provided each year.
This could be a meaningful data set for the Group to review and propose rationalization.
We hope that within these six months we can both agree the principles to apply to future and previous mandates, as well as agree some concrete, tangible outcomes which will support the UN AT process.
We look forward to the discussions and to working alongside the co facilitators and other Member States to advance this important strand of the UNHC process.
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of the United Kingdom.
I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Norway, to be followed by Zimbabwe.

**Norway | Representative**

Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Co Chairs and first of all, a warm congratulations to both of you on your appointment to chair this informal group and also to shepherd this mandate implementation review process.
You have our full support and confidence in the job and the duties you take on.
Norway will engage actively and constructively to achieve solutions and also practical results that lead to a more effective un.
Let me just quickly emphasize three main points.
First, let me stress that the SG report on Mandate Implementation Review serves as a very helpful entry point for us as Member States and in the negotiation process because it expands the scope of the concept of mandate implementation by including both the design or the creation phase and also the review phase of implementation of the mandates.
And most importantly, it advances a perspective on systemic improvements by focusing on some key guiding principles, uninformed options.
As part of that, I'm stressing this because we will support from our side a process that is forward looking and which has a broad scope, setting a new standard for mandate creation, implementation and review and the methodology for that.
Our key goal for this phase should therefore be to agree on some of these guiding principles that will have a positive and very concrete impact on the future design of mandates and the life cycles of the mandates, which collectively can help us together to address what is today the structural problem, and that's the propitiation of overlapping and duplicative mandates.
My second key point, and that's briefly on your three guiding questions.
I mean very many good constructive ideas have been raised in the meeting.
I think from our side we just want to say that we believe it's crucial to combine two sets of key elements in this first is to ensure inclusivity throughout the process and that's first and foremost related to us as Member States.
So all Member States must be enabled and able to participate full.
So it has to be transparent.
But it also has to involve a very significant support role, not by Guy Ryder himself, but his very well staffed team and the Secretariat throughout all the stages by providing what he also stressed is substantive support.
The second element is clearly to secure, and we don't have yet any strong opinions whether it needs by nature to be sequential or whether things could be mixed throughout the process.
But what is key for us is that we must be able to secure a process where both the informal part of negotiations are sufficiently that you as co chairs, sufficiently allow time for that phase.
But secondly, and maybe most importantly is to ensure deep thematic, substantive discussions before going into the nitty gritty details of text based negotiations.
And in that phase, clearly the role of the Secretariat must be protected and supported.
Thirdly, and finally, we as Norway remain very committed to engage with all, I mean with you, but of course with all Member States both across and within regional groups.
And we like both very constructively and creatively to contribute to a truly collective process that must be collective if we're going to succeed by finding an area of convergence and consensus at the end finally, for us it will be vital to find the right balance between all the three main pillars in this work and it cannot be any cherry picking and all three will count as most importantly vis a vis each other.
So with those words, thank you and we're looking forward.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Norway.
Give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Zimbabwe who will be followed by Trinidad and Tobago.

**Zimbabwe | Representative**

Thank you coaches.
Let me begin by congratulating you Ambassador Wallace and Ambassador Shualga on your appointment as Co Chairs of this informal ad hoc Working Group.
You can be assured of Zimbabwe's full support.
My delegation aligns itself with a statement that was delivered on behalf of the G77 in China and the African Group and I will share the following perspectives in my national capacity in response to the guiding questions, Zimbabwe have used this ADWOC Working Group as a critical component of the UN80 initiative which should provide an open, transparent and inclusive platform for the mandate implementation review.
The ADWERK Working Group is however working within a constrained timeframe and this calls for maximum collaboration, flexibility and ultimately consensus.
The report by the Secretary General outlines three areas of mandates life cycle creation, delivery and review.
My delegation wishes to propose that the work of the ADWERK Working Group should consequently follow a thematic approach based on these three areas.
We further propose the compilation of a roadmap of activities of the Working Group.
Central to this roadmap would be an elements paper prepared by the CO chairs based on the three focus areas and the Secretary General's recommendations.
Member States could be invited to submit written inputs which would be synthesized into an Outcome document with a zero draft to be ready for circulation well ahead of the report back meeting on 15 December 2025.
This approach would reduce the need for multiple physical meetings during the peak of Committee work, thereby easing the burden on smaller delegations.
Further, we propose that the roadmap includes a provision for three interactive dialogue sessions between January and March 2026.
These sessions could be utilized as consultative sessions with the objective of finalizing the outcome document.
Additionally, Zimbabwe envisages the adoption of a resolution endorsing this outcome document before the conclusion of the 80th session.
We welcome the commitment by the Secretariat to support Member states in implementing WE Extreme 2 and encourage the Secretary General to regularly update Member States on the progress in the activities outlined in the Report that are within its authority and we thank Mr.
Guy Ryder for that reassurance.
Let us therefore utilize this opportunity to work together towards a mandate in implementation review process which culminates in an agile fit for purpose United nations capable of effectively and efficiently responding to the world's pressing challenges.
I wish to assure you coaches of Zimbabwe's constructive participation during deliberations.
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Trinidad and Tobago who will be followed by U Uruguay

**Trinidad and Tobago | Representative**

thank you Chair firstly, congratulations to both of you Chair on your ascension to your respective co Chair positions.
Chair Trinidad and Tobago aligns itself with the statement delivered by Belize on behalf of CARICOM and the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of the group of 77 as well as the statement delivered by Palau on behalf of oasis.
Trinidad and Tobago wishes to highlight the need to commit ourselves to a process that is open, transparent and accessible by all, ensuring primacy, recency and accessibility in addition to transparency of all documents and ensure whatever we embark upon can be tracked and measured, knowing fully well, Chair that what gets measured gets done, what gets measured gets improved.
Also, Chair ensure practical reconciliation and consolidation of mandates, the outcome of which can be appropriately aligned and matched to the requisite resources, if so required, to ensure that the follow up mechanism of these mandates can be optimally operationalized.
Finally, Chair, I wish to remind my colleagues and all of us that this process can be at times challenging, perhaps to match the challenging times that we face requiring patience, commitment, communication, trust and transparency in the conduct of our business.
I wish to reiterate Trinidad and Tobago is committed to retooling, reforming and renewing our organization and we stand ready to roll up our sleeves in this regard.
We look forward to a better, stronger and smarter, more agile un.
So said.
Thank you Chair

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Trinidad and Tobago.
Give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Uruguay who will be followed by Kuwait and then the final speaker will be Chile.

**Uruguay | Representative**

Muches.
Thank you.
So co Chairs, thank you to the USG Guide writer as well.
We align Uruguay aligns itself to the G77 and China statement as well as the Small States Group Declaration today.
And we are also of the view of the of the need for informed decisions, evidence based decision and we also value the work on the role of the Secretariat in in providing extra additional information on for example actual duplications of mandates where we can rationalize the agenda.
We need this listening mode or consultative mode at the beginning be it in thematic cluster sessions or also at a certain point the cross sectoral also view because the three pillars as we know all know are equally important and are interdependent and they all enrich the others.
We we don't want the as it also was said by several colleagues, the cherry picking, forgetting some of them.
It's not the opportunity to for regressions or for polarization.
This is what we want to avoid at this point.
If we want efficiencies and effectiveness, we need to look for synergies and the synergies of the three pillars.
There are some permanent interests of the United nations like it is the human rights and fundamental freedoms which cannot simply have a sunset close.
Just to put an example, probably some others very sensitive and political issues which are pending of solution cannot be subject to a sunset clause either because it signals something that there's something to be done yet.
So no automatisms are needed.
Yes, we need some rationalization and we heard several concrete proposals and we are going to participate in a very constructive way the impact on the ground which very much is needed.
We value all of them from the guidance, the simple guidance, the sharing of best practices.
Everything really is an impact on the ground.
And so we need to look for those type of results.
Thank you so much.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Uruguay.
I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Kuwait and then Chile.

**Kuwait | Permanent Representative | (GCC)**

Thank you, Mr.
Chair. Madam President, Excellencies and distinguished colleagues.
I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council gcc, the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Sultan of Oman, the State of Qatar, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the the United Arab Emirates and my own country, the State of Kuwait.
The GCC aligns itself with the statement delivered by the Republic of Iraq on behalf of the group of 77 in China.
@ the outset of our statement we express our gratitude for convening the first meeting of the informal Ad Hoc Working group on the UN 80 initiative and the remarks of Her Excellency Annelina Baerbock, President of the General Assembly.
The GCC extends its sincere congratulations to Her Excellency Ambassador Carolyn Schwalger, Permanent Representative of New Zealand and to His Excellency Ambassador Brian Wallace, Permanent Representative of Jamaica, on appointment as co facilitators for the IAHWG on the UN80 initiative.
And we affirm support for their efforts in fulfilling the task ahead.
Madam Chair, the GCC emphasizes the importance of focusing the efforts of the Informal Working Group on strengthening multilateralism and ensuring the full and effective participation of all Member States with adherence to the principles established in the United Nations Charter, particularly those related to preserving the effectiveness and its pivotal role of the United Nations.
The Group also stresses the importance of taking into account the bustling schedule of the United nations when setting the timeline of work of the IHWG and provide ample time and sufficient means to ensure effective participation by all Member States in in its work in order to ensure its effectiveness.
On this note, the GCC supports the proposal submitted by the Group of 77 in China to establish a detailed work plan for the informal Working Group.
We further recommend that the subject of each meeting be clearly specified in advance to facilitate the effective management of Member States.
The GCC also underscores the importance of adhering to the principles of transparency and inclusivity throughout the upcoming deliberations, with a view to ensuring a successful outcome of the mandate implementation review Under Work Stream 2 and with the overarching objective of fostering a United nations that is fit for purpose and equipped to address both present and future challenges.
In conclusion, the GCC affirms its readiness to support the work of the informal Ad Hoc Working Group to ensure the delivery of its mandate.
We take this opportunity to emphasize the need to approach this process with a constructive, comprehensive and pragmatic approach that takes into account the interests of all Member States without exception.
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

Please allow me to thank the distinguished representative of Kuwait, especially for their grace and for their flexibility in accommodating the lack of translation and the miscommunication that led to that.
So, thank you so much.
I now give the floor to the final speaker for today's meeting, the distinguished representative of Chile.
Thank you.
Co Chairs, allow me to congratulate you on your appointment to this important position.

**Chile | Representative**

I wish you every success in your future deliberations.
We align ourselves with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of the group of 77 and China as a contribution to the discussion on the way forward.
In pursuing the objectives of this ad hoc working group, our delegation would like to offer the following suggestions.
First, that our work, at least in its initial stage, remain firmly guided by the report of the Secretary General and its recommendations.
This report, the result of a significant effort, should not be disregarded.
Rather, it must serve as the starting point for the endeavors we will undertake in the months ahead.
Second, that the work aimed at formulating a framework for future mandates be organized around the three key steps of the mandate Life cycle, creation, delivery and review.
Structuring our discussions in this manner would allow for a more effective and focused process than, for example, addressing all of the Secretary General's recommendations at once.
Third, that the Secretary General's recommendations on each of these key steps served as the foundation of our deliberations, asking, when needed, the support from the Secretariat to share deeper analysis and that our discussions remain centered on them while allowing space for potential new additional proposals from member states.
In conclusion, I would like to reiterate our support for the co chairs and reaffirm Chile's CO commitment to engaging constructively in the work of these working groups.
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Chile colleagues.
Before I hand back to my co chair for some closing remarks and to close the meeting, I just wanted to say how optimistic I am that we have been able to begin this process with such a hopeful tone.
I think it augurs well for the process that we embark on from here.
And, and let me just take this opportunity to wish you all a successful high level week.
I hope you get some rest this weekend.
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Carolyn Schwalger | Co-Chair**

Thank you, Ambassador Wallace. Well, I agree.
I think we've had an immensely thoughtful exchange today.
We know there's complexity to these issues and I think we've seen that in your interventions.
But I also feel that we've had a really genuine sign of commitment by all of you to both this process, but also to the broader strengthening of the organisation.
On behalf of.
We're going to be informal, right?
On behalf of Brian and I really like to thank all of the delegations for the constructive spirit which you have engaged in this morning.
We did hear a range of people perspectives and we acknowledge that we need to think about that as we think about how we guide our collective work and how we move forward to, I guess, chart the next steps in front of us.
We will remain in close contact with you.
Communication will be key throughout this process and we really do hope that you will continue to participate at the highest level possible so that we can can get through the work of this group in a meaningful way that leads to a more stronger and effective and efficient United Nations.
We will advise you of our next meeting of the informal ad hoc working group.
The date is still to be announced, but be assured that we will be very mindful of the thinking that you have all shared with us today about the importance for a clear work process program and also one deconflicted to the extent possible with the main committees.
So we will circulate a letter to you in due course.
Once again, thank you to the PGA team.
Thank you very much to Under Secretary General Guy Rider.
Thank you very much to the Secretariat for all your support in getting us ready in a short period of time.
Thank you to all the delegations who participated today.
And thank you so much to the teams from Jamaica and New Zealand who've put in so much hard work to get us here in such a short amount of time.
Happy high level week, everybody.
The meeting is adjourned.
