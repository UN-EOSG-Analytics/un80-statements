# Session 7 | Mandate Review briefing - Panel followed by questions from members of the working group (Nov 25, 2025) 

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I call to order the informal meeting of the Working Group to hear a technical briefing on mandate implementation.
We warmly welcome all of you to this technical briefing.
We recognise the presence of Mr. Guy Ryder, under Secretary General for Policy and chair of the UN 80 taskforce.
Mr. Locke Bahadur Thapa, Permanent Representative of Nepal to the United nations and President of the Economic and Social Council Ms. Inga Anderson, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program Ms. Ilse Branz Kheras, Assistant Secretary General for human rights and Ms. Claudia Bans, director of the Security Council Affairs Division.
Before handing the floor to our briefers, please, please allow me to deliver some opening remarks on behalf of the co Chairs.
We warmly thank Member States for your continued engagement in this important process.
The briefings we convened on mandate creation and implementation provided new important data analysis, information and real world examples to Working Group members.
Your questions to the briefers have so far unearthed further insights and your remarks at our two consultations have been thoughtful and have given us some good ideas that we have carefully noted.
We hope that today's briefing on mandate review will be just as fruitful.
Our briefers will discuss how UN mandates are reviewed across the UN system and how successful, coordinated and useful or not these are.
They will of course also elaborate on the relationship between mandate creation, implementation and review from their perspectives.
At our briefings and consultations, as well as in our meetings with Working Group members, we have consistently heard agreement among the membership that reform is urgently needed.
We are at risk of losing the confidence of both our publics and political decision makers.
And to build this back, we must restore the UN's ability to deliver across its its core mandates.
We have heard about the clear through line between mandate creation and mandate implementation.
But as you all know, and as many of you have mentioned in your statements, this should not be the end of the story.
Without any review mechanisms, we will not be able to accurately assess how we are delivering against the objectives we set ourselves, nor the impact our decisions have on the lives of our constituents.
The information and analysis that mandate reviews can uncover should play an important role in driving the work of this organisation.
Being able to deliver on our undertakings and course correct where necessary, will naturally strengthen the UN's legitimacy.
As we said last time, we have a responsibility to our citizens and to each other to implement the things we agree to here, the things our public expect of us to deliver for them and for others.
Equally, review mechanisms should allow us to see clearly where we have been successful.
When we have completed our work, we should be able to retire mandates.
Indeed, ending Mandates in this way is maybe the highest measure of success.
We have certain parts of the system have experience in reviewing, recalibrating and completing mandates that we hope to learn from today.
It is for this reason that we encourage working group members to keep an open mind to the analysis they hear today and to be ambitious in the ideas they bring in the coming weeks.
Without this, our ability to achieve change at the scale needed to improve mandate implementation may be compromised.
I now pass the floor to Ambassador Wallace to outline the way ahead and to introduce our briefers.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Good morning.
Today's briefing will be followed by consultations on 3 December, where working group members will again have the opportunity to offer their perspectives and ideas for consideration, as well as to ask further questions.
We apologize for the short turnaround, but we trust in your understanding of the challenging timelines and constraints we face in this and other processes and remain confident that you are up to the task.
As with our prior briefings, the briefers today have been selected for their experience with mandate implementation.
They will present from different perspectives for us to all consider, and there will be an opportunity for questions from the floor once they have all presented.
Like all of us here today, they are invested in the good functioning of the UN.
With that, I give the floor to Mr. Guy Ryder, under Secretary General for Policy and Chair of the UNAT Task Force.

**UN Secretariat | Guy Ryder | USG Policy**

Thank you very much indeed.
Ambassador Wallace, Ambassador Schwalger.
Good morning, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen.
Well, thank you for this new opportunity to speak with you, to introduce the third stage of this mandate life cycle, the stage that we commonly refer to as the mandate review stage.
And perhaps just to situate this discussion in the overall context of this process, we could look at this when it's up.
Diagram of the mandate life cycle.
I wonder if we can show it.
Next one.
There we are.
This is just to remind us that we're in a mandate life cycle approach, which goes from the.
The creation of mandates, how you adopt resolutions, the second stage of delivery, how the UN system implements mandates by turning them into activities to be undertaken across all pillars of the organization.
That's the delivery phase.
And then what we're coming on to now, crucially, the third phase, in which member states come back to look at whether the work that the UN system has undertaken is indeed achieving the results intended and whether mandates remain relevant or whether they need to be adjusted.
And I think one way of looking at this review phase of the cycle is to see it as a sort of a steering operation where member states have the opportunity to set the forward trajectory of the organization and its activities.
And if we're able to do that well, the entire mandate cycle can stay on course, moving us where we want to get to towards greater positive impact.
And alternatively, when it's not done so well, I think we can all see that there is a danger that the system can enter into a sort of drift, and we want to avoid that.
Now, as we see it, for a mandate review process to work optimally, two conditions reflected in the graphic before you would need to be met.
Firstly, Member States would need to have available to them a review process that allows them to steer strategically, not simply automatically to repeat discussions year after year as a sort of a. A default position.
But that's only one half of the story.
The other half is that the UN system, our responsibility is to provide information that you need to assess the work that we have undertaken.
You need to have access to clear plans, clear results, and a presentation of the links between resource utilization and outcomes obtained.
So we believe these two components would be integral to a successful review phase.
Now, perhaps I can go through each of these components in turn, beginning with the Member State review process.
Now, the question we might ask is what are the means at the disposal of Member States to provide the type of steer that the organization requires?
Obviously, the resolutions that you adopt are the most important and obvious instrument at your disposal.
But there is more than that because you shape the organization's direction also by deciding what goes on the agenda, how often issues come back for discussion, the kinds of reports that you want and how frequently you want them.
And then all of this comes on top of the resolutions that you ultimately adopt.
All of this indicates that you Member States are in the pilot seat throughout this entire process.
You set the course and the UN system must follow your direction and do it to its best abilities.
Now, in the mandates report, we identified initially the issue of frequently recurring business with limited changes to mandates.
That's in quotes.
Frequently recurring business with limited changes to mandates.
And some of the statistics that we presented in the report, I think are quite suggestive.
In 2024, the General assembly discussed about 370 agenda items and sub items.
And of these, about 60%.
Two hundred and fifteen are discussed every year.
Thirty percent of the issues discussed have been considered since 1990, and 55% of recurring resolutions have been very similar to the ones adopted in previous years, meaning at least 80% of the text is identical, the same word for word.
And these numbers, as I've said, are suggestive that in certain aspects, the steering process that I'VE talked to might simply be operating by autopilot now.
Currently, as I've indicated, many agenda items come back year after year and there may be reason for that.
I don't think it is self evident that this is inappropriate, particularly for entity specific or operational mandates.
It may be that this makes perfect sense, but perhaps for larger system wide transformative agenda, the ones where change takes time, reviewing them less frequently but perhaps with more time and attention could be more useful.
It could give space for meaningful progress over time and means that when negotiations do happen there is a real addition of value.
As has been stressed by many of you in previous meetings in this working group, and I recall Ambassador Wray's parting intervention last time, these processes are not set in stone, they are amenable to change.
The periodicity of considering agenda items, requesting reports and adopting resolutions can, if you so decide, all be adapted so that issues stay on the radar but recur at the most appropriate and productive intervals possible.
In the report we also underlined that Member States could decide to undertake collective assessments of mandates, addressing related issues rather than addressing mandates one by one.
Now these kinds of collective reviews, if I could call them those, they do happen, but they are the exception rather than the rule.
One example of a collective review is the revitalization of the General assembly, which you are all familiar with.
Another is the quadriennnual Comprehensive Policy Review, the QCPR process, which takes a strategic system wide view of the entirety of the UN development system.
And as you are aware, the QCPR runs on a four year cycle, setting expectations for the entire UN development system, not just entity by entity or individual issue by issue.
And this longer cycle creates a degree of space for real delivery, for learning, and for adjusting course in ways which are meaningful and consequential.
There are other examples, but perhaps a QCPR approach is one which is instructive for other pillars as well.
A further issue that we highlighted in the report is that most mandates do not include review mechanisms in them, and as you can see from this straightforward slide, around 86% of mandates lack any review mechanisms and this means that renewal can become the default setting even when circumstances may have changed.
Of the 14% of UN mandates which do include review clauses, it's interesting to note that most are resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the Human Rights Council.
They tend to relate to peace operations, fact finding missions or commissions of inquiry or sanctions measures.
And I think you will hear more about these from my colleagues with us today in their presentations in the Development Pillar.
One example where we have a Built in process and timeline is Resolution 71 of 2015, the one that adopted the Sustainable Development Goals.
That resolution sets the SDG horizon for 2030, after which member States will review the progress made and determine next steps, as was indeed already the case after the deadline set for the Millennium Development Goals.
So when it matters, clearly these things can be done.
A more recent example, one which might be fresh in the memory of many of us, is General assembly resolution 79325 on the establishment and functioning of the independent Artificial Intelligence Panel.
That resolution includes a review mechanism and timeline, and I quote, the continuation of the terms of reference of the Panel and the dialogue may be considered by the General assembly during the review of the Global Digital compact at its 82nd session.
These are examples of resolutions which do have built in review mechanisms and we might learn from them.
In these cases, the predictability of the review process and timeline may be helpful in ensuring that structured discussions among Member States are prioritized, and this in itself can lead to better outcomes.
Now, having said all of that in respect of Member States, let me recall the role of the the system itself, the UN system, in this process, the second component that I mentioned at the outset, and recall the four potential solutions in this regard that were included in the Secretary General's report.
And I would recall that these are the manner in which Member States could seek to systematize review practices across mandating bodies, make review clauses the norm, review and steer impact more collectively, meaning at the level of systems development, humanitarian peace and security, or the human rights pillar and streamline agenda to spend less time repeating discussions and more time steering strategically.
Sorry, that part still belongs to the Member States component.
I'm now moving on to the UN System component Excellency's colleagues.
As it regards the UN System side, our role is to provide inputs to enable your review to operate optimally.
As I've said, for reviews to work well, the system must provide a clear picture on how mandates translate into results.
And here there are four things we need to pay attention to.
We need a roadmap, a strategic plan on what goals any entity is pursuing long term.
We need a results chain, a framework linking resources to activities, outputs and outcomes.
A budget that shows value organized around results, not just cost categories in a more administrative manner.
And we need strong communication reports that show our stakeholders how our work is making a difference.
Today, as our report reflects, the challenge is that these plans, these results change.
These budgets often look different in different parts of the UN system.
Some entities have strategic plans, others do not.
Some have Integrated results and resource frameworks, but many don't.
And how we measure results differs across UN entities.
Reporting and planning tools are inconsistent.
The consequence of all of this is that it makes it hard for you, our Member States, to judge system wide performance or compare the impact of the work of different entities and from this to draw appropriate conclusions.
So that is why we point to one simple but critical potential solution to these challenges in the Secretary General's report.
And that is to strengthen and harmonize management for results mechanisms across the UN system, including how results are measured and how they are communicated.
Breaking that down in concrete terms, that means that every major entity should have, firstly, a multi year strategic plan, secondly, an integrated results and resource framework based on a system wide standard, and thirdly, a budget that is organized around results, not just categories like staff and operations, administrative cost categories.
And when results chains are completed are complete.
Excuse me.
And when budgets show how they contribute to outcomes, this enables a lot of things to happen.
It enables you to have a system wide view of impact and how it is obtained, to see how different entities contribute to shared outcomes, this thorny issue of overlap and duplication, to see whether resources are aligned with results and to see where adjustments might be needed.
Co Chairs, Dear participants, let me draw to a conclusion by clarifying that this type of mandate review is not simply about adding another layer of bureaucracy or process.
It can be a tool for you to ensure that the UN system is and remains focused, coherent, effective and accountable.
With better designed review cycles and stronger performance information, we can make our mandate delivery more strategic and above all, more impactful.
Ultimately then, this is not about process, it's about people.
It's about the 8 billion people the UN system connects to shared goals.
It's about the 400 million people whose lives the UN helps improve on the ground, most of them in least developed countries.
So I hope that we can work together through this working group to deliver better for the people who depend on us.
And I thank you once again for this opportunity and look forward to your comments and questions.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Thank you, Jess. Thank you, Guy. Thank you.
I now give the floor to Mr. Lok Bahadur Tafa, Permanent Representative of Nepal to the United nations and President of the Economic and Social Council.

**Nepal | Lok Bahadur Thapa | PR; ECOSOC President**

Thank you, distinguished Co Chairs, Excellencies, distinguished delegations.
Thank you Co Chairs for inviting me today to join you.
It is always a pleasure to talk about the ECOSOCS mandate, which is firmly rooted in the Charter entrusting the Council with responsibilities to promote international cooperations on economic, social, cultural, educational, health and related issues.
ECOSOC serves as a platform for dialogue and policymaking, coordinating the UN development systems and engaging diverse stakeholders.
ECOSOCS approaches the reviews stakeholders stage of the mandate life cycle through a range of legislative and oversight functions derived from the UN Charter GA resolutions and outcomes of the UN conferences and summits.
Since the adoptions of the 2030 Agenda, ECOSOC has focused on coherence across the UN systems to support member states in meeting the global commitments.
The High Level Political Forum, convened annually under its auspices, is the central platform to review SDG progress, share lessons and adopt our ministerial declarations.
Beyond the hlpf, ECOSOC holds annual forums on financing for development, partnerships, youth and science and technology and innovations, adopting resolutions and recommendations across its program of work.
It also responds to urgent global issues through special meetings that inform its broader sessions.
Excellencies Viewing its own annual work program, the Council is also interested to oversee the work of five regional Commissions, eight functional Commissions, nine Export Committees, two Standing Committees, and a range of other bodies that report to it.
These subsidiary bodies address a wide range of sustainable development issues, from statistics and crime prevention to science and technology, forest population, gender equality, indigenous peoples issues, as well as the needs of the LECs.
They regularly report on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.
The Council periodically reviews their work on the basis of the recommendations contained in the reports of the subsidiary bodies as well as provides guidance based on current trends and needs on their future work.
For instance, during its 2025 sessions, Ecosoc adopted 35 resolutions, signed 45 decisions, not including those related to elections.
The Council discharges its charter mandated coordination functions by reviewing the work undertaken by the UN systems on the sustainable development issues across the economic, social, health and related fields, with a view to promoting coordinated actions and advancing long term solutions.
Excellencies in recent years there have been efforts to streamline mandates.
The ECOSOC Vice President, Costa rica at the 2025 session issued a Call to Action for the Humanitarian affairs segment in state of negotiating a resolution.
Streamlining mandates also includes avoiding the introduction of new mandates unless accompanied by commensurate resources or by the clear adjustment or conclusion of existing overlapping obligations.
There are also lessons learned from the recent experiences, particularly regarding the process of adoption of the Ministerial Declaration at both HLPF and Ecosoc.
The 2024 Ministerial Declaration illustrated challenges due to procedural arrangements and the potential conflicts caused by the different voting rights at the ECOSOC and the hlpf.
Member States may wish to address these situations during the forthcoming GA review of ECOSOC and the HLPF Excellencies The General assembly periodically reviews ECOSOC work and the provisions governing the HLPF in its resolutions 78285 the General assembly agreed to fully review at its 80th sessions the arrangement of the ecosocial and the HLPF.
These reviews will be conducted jointly.
Building on the lesson learned to ensure alignment with the broader 2030 Agenda follow up processes following GA Resolution 75 290A ECOSOC launched an internal review of its subsidiary bodies in 2022 facilitated by the Council Vice President.
The process included assessment and recommendations by the Bureau of ecosoc Functional Commissions and expert bodies and informal consultations among Member States.
This process resulted in ECOSOC Decisions 2022334 inviting implementations of the recommendations contained in the Vice President's summary.
Furthermore, a number of ECOSUC functional commissions also conduct periodic reviews of their own working methods.
The next review of ECOSAC subsidiary bodies initially mandated for 2026 is proposed to be postponed to 2027 to allow the process to be informed by the outcomes of the GA review process.
In line with the fact of the future, ECOSHOCK launched an intergovernmental process in 2025 to explore option to revitalize the CSW Co facilitated by Ireland and St. Kitts and Navies.
The process concluded with the adoption of ECOSOC resolutions on revitalizations of the CSW reaffirming CSW's role in follow up to the Fourth World Conference on Women and its outcome.
The efforts have also been made to foster more effective complementarity between the General assembly and ecosac with the QCPR as an example of the two bodies identifying complementary rules namely of policymaking one for the GA every four years and the annual oversight of implementation and guidance by Member States to the UN Development Systems and Funding Compact ousted under ECOSOC in its Operational Activities for Development segment.
Regular dialogue between the President of the GA and ECOSOC help ensure coherence including monthly meetings and annual joint meetings to identify shared and important issues of relevance to Member States Excellencies regarding the voluntary national reviews.
The 2030 Agenda encourages member States to undertake regular and inclusive reviews of progress at national and sub national levels.
These reviews are intended to be voluntary and country driven by presented at the HLPF under the auspices of ECOSA.
Since 2015, 402 PNRs have been presented by 190 countries and the European Union with 148 countries submitting two or more reviews.
The Resolution 75-190B suggested improvements the BNRs encouraging countries to highlight challenges, gaps and next steps to accelerate the implementation of the SDG and to conduct a BNR once the four year cycle of the hlpf.
Nonetheless, certain challenges in the BNR process continue to be observed and addressing them could further strengthen the mechanisms, effectiveness and impact Excellencies.
Integrated nature of the 2030 agenda requires close cooperations across intergovernmental bodies.
The upcoming ECOSOC and HLPF review by the GA is an opportunity to reflect on the Council work and enhance the complementarity between ECOSOC and HLPF to ensure that their work is mutually reinforcing and accelerate the 2030 Agenda implementation.
Taken together, the UN 80 initiative, the General assembly review of EcoShock and HLPF at its 80th session and the EcoShock review of its subsidiary machinery create opportunities for Member States to strengthen the functions, coherence and the impact of the ECOSAC and HLPF in advancing the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs.
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the president of Ecosop.
I now give the floor to Ms. Inga Anderson, executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program.

**UNEP | Inger Andersen | Executive Director**

Thank you very much and good evening from Nairobi, the only global headquarters of the United nations in the Global South.
It's a pleasure and honor to speak here today this evening and we think that this mandate review is very critical and we've engaged very much throughout the process.
UNEP, the United Nations Environment Program, was founded in 1972 in the Stockholm Conference and it really is the place whereby mandate we're supposed to promote international cooperation on the environment, keep the environment under review, which essentially is science, and serve as a focal point for environmental action within the UN system.
And so being that pillar of the environment, we are enriched when other agencies take on the environmental issue but but address it through their mandate lens, be it human rights, be it children, be it health, et cetera.
So what some would call decentralization of the environmental mandate to the country, we call it a great strengthening and we need to think about this like you do in the context of your ministries of environment, where of course, whether it's roads or transport or urban or health environment features just as much so for UNEP itself.
Over the years since 1972 we have seen Member States through the UNEP processes give birth to a large number of conventions and two of these, you will know well, are not managed by UNEP or not hosted by UNEP.
That will be climate change and desertification.
But 17 others are indeed hosted by UNEP.
And of course, therefore but of course answerable to the party driven governance process of the COP structure, which you will know very well in 2022 and again in 2024 at the United Nations Environment assembly, discussions were held.
How can we ensure that the Environmental assembly, the United Nations Environmental assembly, creates a greater degree of synergy without interfering in the sovereign nature, if I can say so, of the multilateral environmental agreements and their cops?
And so at this point now in the unea, the United Nations Environment assembly, each assembly has an MEA day, an MEA Week, mea, Multilateral Environment Agreement.
Executive Directors and Presidents come and participate in high level discussions and panels, et cetera.
There's a tent, because we are a tent city here.
When we have unea, which the whole week will focus on MEA dialogue precisely to enable a greater synergistic conversation, so to say, then how do we work and how do we maximize the impact of the mandates that are given to us by Member States through the United Nations Environment Assembly?
Well, Member States are about to, in December, at the upcoming UNEA Environment assembly, approve the next four year medium term strategy and the two year program of work.
This will be decided of course at the conference, but at the Assembly.
But essentially it will deal with the three elements that UNEPT works on.
If I can summarize very much, climate stability, nature, biodiversity and land and pollution.
And what we then do is we construct a one impact framework that ensures that the whole of UNEP approach, where the different programs and projects that are funded by a variety of sources which are delivering obviously the mandate are then reported on and leads to an organizationally agreed by Member States vision under the medium term strategy.
So the impact framework also rides on a very, very strong measurement framework which shows how the work that we are doing here at UNEP is aligned with the International Agreed Goals, I.e.
the goals in the Climate Convention, in the Chemical Conventions, in the Biodiversity Convention, et cetera.
And so that allows for that.
Even though these multilateral environmental agreements and their COPS take their decisions outside of the UNEA structure, nevertheless, a program that we see Member States approve is underpinning the very commitments that Member States have made in the COP structure.
So therefore, we have an integrated theory of change that link the mandates to measurable outcomes and that ensures that we translate those mandates that have derived from UNEA or indeed from the cops into quantifiable impact and not just sort of activities.
And the targets for these are set on the basis of implementation capacity and budgets, obviously.
And so when it comes to resource mobilization, because we only receive around 3% of our monies from the regular budget and the rest we mobilize.
And so we seek to do this based on an allocation of all resources.
We have a strategic planning process that is linked with program budgeting.
Our total program in a two year period is just under 3 billion.
The vast amount of this obviously being programmatic.
And we mobilize as if regular budget, but voluntary indicative scale of contribution just usually is around 19 million or so per year.
That helps to pay for the spine of the organization.
So when we seek to then report to Member States, we seek to show progress against agreed indicators which are publicly available.
I should say to ensure that UNEP can be transparent and very much seen that here's what the science says, here's what Member States decided, here's what UNEP is doing.
That model demonstrates very much how the results based evidence informs, performs the mandate review and connects the mandates to the results, to the learning, etc.
We do regular program performance reports to Member States.
We do that on a quarterly basis.
And so there's also a learning dimension obviously in that.
So through all of this with a mandate, we take very much, if I can say so, a life cycle approach to the mandate that is given to us, that are given to us by Member States, the strategic guidance, the development, support and implementation.
Now, since we are supposed to keep the environment under the review and therefore do the science, if I can say so, and you will recall that IPCC was created by a UNEP Governing Council resolution, you will recall that ipbs, a Biodiversity and Land Science Policy Panel, was created by a UNEP Governing Council resolution.
And just recently the Intergovernmental Science Policy Panel on Chemicals, Waste and Pollution Created by UNEA resolution.
That science plus what UNEP Secretariat does itself allows us to do some degree of horizon watching to therefore the Executive Director about nine months or so before the United Nations Environment assembly issue a report to Member States saying these are the areas that are sort of horizon issues where you may wish to.
Well, recognizing that resolutions are a totally sovereign issue pertaining to Member States and prerogative.
Nevertheless, as we are supposed to review the science, we say here are areas that are coming up that are urgent or important or under attended to.
Member States may then decide or not to take inspiration from the Executive Director's report to submit resolutions in that space.
Once resolutions begin to be submitted, we submit a what we call a technical note on each resolution.
This is a technical note that deals with five issues.
How is that particular resolution aligned with the existing mandate and a strategy that you are about to approve at the same assembly, what is the relationship to existing mandates either within UNEP or in other fora that is is it duplicative?
In which case we would suggest it's duplicative and therefore you may wish to rethink Third, a legal assessment on the substance and procedural matters.
Fourth, the impact of the proposed draft.
How would we measure whether we have done the thing that is being proposed?
And fifth, how much is it going to cost?
And so this we make available this Technical Note to Member States well ahead of the United Nations Environment assembly to allow Member States to use this as they would see fit for their consideration and deliberations.
We also allow us assign a technical, technically, scientifically and technical qualified focal point to be available to Member States in each of the resolution discussion meetings and of course we provide oral briefing briefings to Member States on the technical notes to ensure that some of the finer technical and scientific issues are highlighted.
Now, once a resolution has been adopted, we then support Member States through the implementation tracking portal and reporting portal.
We have established a resolutions portal that is publicly accessible and that monitors and reports on how we're doing on resolution A, B or C. It tracks and outlines the implementation plans for each resolution.
It provides milestones, the results, the availability of resources, the learning, the opportunity and the challenges, the risks and the lessons learned, the partners and so on and so forth.
And because we see of course Member States circulate in and out in terms of our permanent representatives, so we do familiarization sessions with permanent missions with this tracker so that they themselves, when new PRs come in, can follow this through.
And when we have completed a task, and an obvious one would be that we were asked two years ago to help establish the Science Policy Panel on Chemicals, Waste and Pollution and in July of this year this got gaveled and so we therefore have this panel.
So now that resolution can be retired, but when a resolution has been completed, then the monitoring and reporting portal for resolutions will provide a detailed report on the completion of that particular resolution.
Now you asked me my final point to reflect on the SG's report on the proposed solutions to improve the mandate review and we support all of the above and then some we think that there's a lot that could be done to follow quicker through, to monitor better, maybe particularly in two areas, to systematize and to reinforce the efforts that are underway to strengthen the mandate review mechanisms and to ensure that these efforts are in place across the various mandating bodies and also to include inspiring clauses as we just heard from USG Guy Ryder in the resolutions having more explicit mention of what is the results, when is it achieved and what is the lifespan, so that these resolutions are not carried into the forever, or at least we could have objective conditionalities under which something is continued or not, so sort of on, off switch.
Additionally, for the environmental pillar, of course, Member States may want to consider how they could delineate better what belongs in the assembly that the General assembly has established, the United Nations Environment assembly, which has the technical skills, the Scientific Secretariat and the environmental mandate related to the United nations and what they may choose to put at unga.
So for us, we very, very much look forward to continuing working on and support the outcome of this working group and to contribute to enhancing the mandate life cycle at this very crucial time for the environment.
Thank you very much.
Cheers.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank Ms. Anderson.
I now give the floor to Ms. Ilse Brands Karis, Assistant Secretary General for Human Rights.

**Ilse Brands Karis | ASG for Human Rights**

Thank you, Ambassador Wallace.
Dear co Chairs, Excellencies, distinguished delegates, it's my honor to represent the High Commissioner and our Office for Human Rights here today.
I wanted to start with just three small contextual points to bring the perspective of human rights into the discussion.

**OHCHR | Ilse Brands Karris | ASG Human Rights**

So obviously this is the focus here, following on previous discussions you've had is the mandate review.
But clearly it relates to impact and prioritization as well as cost effectiveness.
So obviously it links very well into the creation and implementation and efficiency effectiveness strand, as well as the structural programs, of course, also have very, very clear links where human rights is part of it.
A second point is that the Human rights pillar which we here are talking about, it is of course the office of the High Commissioner as the UN entity, as the secretariat, but the ecosystem, importantly is the Human Rights Council with its universal periodic review, the investigative mechanisms, the special procedures, the mechanisms belonging there, but also the treaty bodies.
So we do have we're talking about both Human Rights Council mandates and GA mandates, including the one that actually established the High Commissioner's mandate itself, the broad one, and to more limited extent, ECOSOC as well, ohchr, you may have noticed, has the largest amount number of mandates cited, 877.
But it should be taken into account that they're very varied.
Some are large, some small, long, continuous, versus those that are specific.
So it takes a differentiated approach to deal with those.
We also have the specificity, as you will know, but still a reminder that the Human Rights Council as well as the Office of the High Commissioner's Headquarters are in Geneva.
So we importantly often need to discuss the link between Geneva and New York, the reinforcement of that link that is needed for consistency and effective use of human rights as mandated by Member states.
And obviously it also this mandate review relates to the Human Rights Council streamlining efforts that the Human Rights Council president has been leading on and of course the Human Rights Council third committee links and the working methods as well as review of status of the Human Rights Council.
So all of that for context generally, we certainly also have the same categories of concerns that USG Rider already pointed to for review.
And therefore those recommendations from the SG's report are the ones we definitely need to focus on.
Namely the shortcomings in mandate review process and also limited changes even when reviews do take place.
And also the other side, the gaps regarding the system input relating to impact cost effectiveness.
Obviously that is needed as evidence for the reviews linking also to the resources and budget structure issues and the insufficient attention on the adequacy sustainability of resources for mandates that we obviously need to make sure that the results are more visible.
Both of the Human Rights Council with all of the elements I pointed to as well as the Office of the High Commissioner, there have been many successes on the human rights.
Since we're focusing now maybe on challenges.
So just to point that out, obviously both on the norm setting side of it as well as the actual practice of human rights.
But I will here just note because of limits in time the challenges that we are indeed focusing on we have the proliferation of mandates.
We had 39% more mandates in 10 years.
That is a duplication, resource gaps, politicization of reviews as well, which is a concern on human rights specifically the duplication and fragmentation.
There's multiple mechanisms that cover similar issues, reducing efficiency, visibility, the mandates and USG Rider pointed to this of the Human Rights Council typically do include clauses for review, but that generally range from one to three years.
But renewals nevertheless are often automatic, especially for thematic mandates.
And geographic mandates also are very rarely discontinued.
So we have a review process that lacks rigor and the process influenced at times more by political dynamics rather than a clear and solid impact assessment as is needed clearly.
Also I mentioned the resource gaps, the renewals, if they do in the review, they are doing without the matching resources, not looking at that aspect of it.
So that creates in itself the cycle of implementation deficits.
And obviously that will then impact the impact that assessment that will go into the for that is needed for a solid review.
We also have the reporting overload mechanisms, Human Rights Council mechanisms.
Several of them report both to the Human Rights Council and the General assembly that can duplicate content.
It obviously also increases costs.
So the proposals we have potentially for Member State consideration, especially for the review part here, but we also have other proposals for other discussions.
The High Commissioner had recently a week ago, dialogues with Member States in Geneva.
He looks forward to exchanging also with Member States in New York.
But there's work that was done under the Human Rights Cluster guided and directed by the SG's proposals and that based on reflections both from the experience and also consultations with Member States as well as other stakeholders experts.
So there is a short non paper for discussion on the Human Rights Council specifically that the High Commissioner has shared with with Member States in Geneva and of course we will be looking forward to also discussions on that when that is opportune.
The other part of those proposals include institutionalizing regular evidence based reviews, especially for mandates exceeding a certain duration, reflecting on the criteria for those reviews of course, including prioritization, differentiation of those continuing long term mandates versus the short term ones and others introducing standardized clauses for review with opportunity for decision on continuation or termination of a mandate consider linking any new mandates to the conclusion of existing ones in the review, consolidate overlapping mandates and consider short term or single report mandates for emerging issues strengthening the cross pillar coordination to ensure mandates reflect integrated priorities across peace, development and human rights and ensure transparent and solidly calculated linkage to resources.
That is again the Geneva coming to New York decisions and the Fifth Committee in particular the linking up on the review and content of IT and of course efficiencies measures reducing duplication and reporting to the Human Rights Council and General assembly considering for instance biannual reporting, virtual presentations and consolidate overlapping mandates in various functions, in particular Protection investigators.
There are some initiatives underway and we do have a preliminary version for now already of a mandate mapping tool that OHCHR has developed and is continuing to develop further.
It is to support Member States decision making.
It's a comprehensive overview of mandates mechanisms and reports mandated since 2019.
It focuses especially on identifying overlaps and duplication across Human Rights Council mechanisms, treaty bodies and special procedures.
It is meant to inform rationalization and it is obviously relevant for the 2026 review General assembly review as well and I would like to note that it fits very well with the SG's proposed digital mandate registry and AI tools for use.
That tool is already available for Member States to use, but there is a caveat of course it needs further work and development.
We have been doing it within the resources we had.
It needs more investment in it and also in order to link it to the financial side and obviously increased use of AI as well and digital Technology in a more advanced phase as part of the General Assembly.
Another initiative under the way, the resolution 79 192.
The chair of the third committee and the President of the Human Rights Council are working, as many of you know, on a roadmap for the progressive reduction of the number of mandates reporting to each session of the Third Committee.
And in all of this we also have some emerging good practices that we can point to.
Indeed, on this mapping tool, it has been very well received by Member States because obviously it will help to review and also thus streamline the workload.
The application of criteria when reviewing and before renewing mandates is being also further developed, including examining existing results, merging also related mechanisms, integration of existing experts into new inquiries instead of creating entirely new mechanisms is one also initiative underway.
And also we had from the Human Rights Council last session, the consolidation of special procedures mandates in the first, where there was a first merger of two mandates as pointing the way ahead, potentially of course needing also assessment.
So overall I would like to really thank for the opportunity of being here and the great work of this working group on mandates as an opportunity to really push ahead with all of these necessary initiatives, bringing in the perspective of of New York and Geneva in particular, of course, where the human rights bridging is so necessary.
Certainly the Office of the High Commissioner looks forward to engagement with Member States on these and on other issues.

**Ilse Brands Karris**

And of course the High Commissioner will hope to also be directly engaging on any follow up and really looking at the UN 80 as the great opportunities and also understanding that time is of the essence.
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank Ms. Brands Karris and I'll give the floor to Ms. Claudia Bans, Director, Security Council Affairs Division.

**UN Secretariat | Claudia Bans | Director, Security Council Affairs Division**

Distinguished Co Chairs, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this opportunity to share some insights on how the Security Council conducts mandate review.
I must admit I first hesitated when the co Chairs invited me to be part of this panel.
As the Executive Director of UNEP has already pointed out, the drafting of mandate is a sovereign issue and the prerogative of its members.
The Secretariat is usually not there when Council members negotiate mandates.
However, we are there when they discuss and take decisions on mandates.
And I'm therefore happy to elaborate a bit about one recent trends in the review and termination of mandates by the Security Council and two the procedures, working methods and tools the Council uses to make these decisions and 3 how the Secretariat, and particularly the Security Council Affairs Divisions or my division, supports the Council in this process.
While the Council has applied an array of approaches to mandate creation, review and termination over its 80 years of decision making.
In my remarks I will focus on the Council's contemporary practice.
We can categorize the Council's review of mandates into three broad approaches.
First, for most of its practice after the Cold War, the Council has taken a gradual approach to transitions, drawdowns and determination of mandates, guided by recommendations and findings of Secretariat reviews and assessments, and conducted with varying degrees of coordination and consultations with host states and other relevant stakeholders.
The most prominent examples falling under this category are the reconfiguration, drawdown and eventual termination of peace operations in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Coteva, Timor Leste, Nepal and Guinea Bissau among a number of other countries, probably the success stories when there was a.
Staged approach to their drawdown.
Second, the Council has at occasion used time bound mandates with explicitly set deadlines for reviews, drawdowns and eventual mandate termination, some of which include so called sunset clauses.
This is the case of Somalia and the deployment of the United Special Political Mission, ANTMIS and the African Union led AWSOM Peace Enforcement Mission.
The mandates of these missions include early defined phases of deployment from the very outset, including expected termination dates in the two cases for Antmis it's 2026 and for OSOM it's 2029.
Another example was the creation of the United nations mandate in Colombia in 2016.
It started out with a narrow mandate to support the implementation of the ceasefire and cessation of hostage hostilities, which was later scaled up and transitioned into a mission with a broader mandate to support the implementation of the peace agreement.
The third trend in Council mandate review has been less gradual in approach where major changes or terminations of mandates were made further to requests from host governments or based on case specific considerations of Council members themselves.
In 2023, the Council decided to terminate the mandates of MINUSMA, the Peace Operation in Mali or peacekeeping operation in Mali and unitams in the political mission in Sudan.
Further to request from the host governments Mali and Sudan and in the context of challenging security conditions on the ground.
In 2024, the council did not renew the Mali sanctions regime and thereby effectively terminated the relevant Committee and its Panel of experts.
Similarly, while extending the sanctions regime and the 1718 committee, that's the sanctions committee on DPRK.
In the same year the Council terminated the mandate of Panel of Experts concerning the Democratic People's Republic of the Korea.
Most recently this year in August, the Council decided to terminate after 40 years of deployment the mandate of UNIFIL as of 31st December 2026.
The Council also indicated possible reconfigurations of UNMAHA, that's the UN Mission in Hudaydah in Yemen and Minerso in Western Sahara in the coming year.
Further to upcoming reviews to be conducted by the Secretariat.
Of specific note are also the sanctions regime, in addition to the ones I have already mentioned, which have been adapted regularly, taking into account improvements in the situation on the ground.
The Secretariat has contributed to these reviews by conducting assessment visits with benchmarks identified benchmarks and this assessment coincided with Council decisions to adjust the measures, particularly in lifting the arms embargo vis a vis the governments in Central African Republic and Somalia.
Now, turning to the Council's working methods, I would like to highlight three practices that are closely tied to how the Council review mandates.
The first is the preparation of the Council's monthly Provisional Program of Work, which is the basic planning tool the Council uses to organize its work.
While the program I think it's the previous one.
While the program is agreed upon by Council members on the first working day of the month, this is being prepared with the relevant presidencies at least four months ahead of the actual Presidency.
And this program of work is basically based on it lists all the mandated meetings and mandate renewals and expirations on to which Council members usually add then their elective meetings and signature events.
But the framework of the monthly program is actually based on the mandate and report reporting cycle of the Security Council.
Although there was a significant increase in so called unscheduled or emergency meetings in the past three years, the mandated activities stemming from previous decisions and existing practice continue to form the overall framework for the monthly schedule in the Security Council as part of its support to Council presidencies and members in preparation of this meeting.
Monthly Program SCAD Our Division maintains and circulates to Member two important planning documents on a monthly basis.
One is the monthly Forecast.
It's a document that outlines all the upcoming mandate renewals, reports and expirations and the Security Council Reporting and Mandate Cycle that provide the overview on the upcoming reporting and mandate expiration in accordance with previous decisions and existing practice.
One of the two documents is 100 pages long, but it's structured that you can go month by month, which is useful and for us an indispensable tool to organize the program of work.
Both of these documents are publicly available on the website.
Second, the Council also has, although not a direct correlation to the number of active meeting mandates, but the Council's annual review of the items on its agenda, which is also known as the Summary Statement, is another important way of how Members strive to streamline the work of the Security Council.
So every first week of January each year, the Secretariat publishes a comprehensive version of the Summary Statement in which the items are divided in two categories.
One category is those items on the agenda of the Security Council which have been considered by the Security Council in the preceding three years, and the second one is a category that the items have not been considered by the Security Council.
This is then reviewed to subject by all by Member States.
And those agenda items which have not been considered are actually due to deletion.
They will be deleted from the agenda of the Council unless a Member State sends a letter and requests that the agenda item is maintained on the agenda of the Security Council.
This process of review was introduced in 1996.
Around 1996. In 1993, there were 207 items on the agenda of the Security Council, and now it's 65.
So in the past 10 years it was around 60 agenda items on the Council's agenda.
The third important aspect of mandate review is the role of penholders in Council decision making and mandate review.
Penholdership is codified in the Presidential Note, and it remains an informal arrangement whereby one or more Council members initiate and chair the informal drafting process.
The aim of the penholdership, as described in note 507, was to foster timely initiatives to ensure Council action while preserving the continuity of and with a view to enhancing efficiency in the work of the Council.
These penholders, they have a role as conveners of the drafting process and they have significant influence in setting out the methodology and content of mandate reviews in the Council.
Council members have also encouraged penholders to prioritize the fortune of consensus census, ensure early exchange of information, informal consultations with the broader United nations membership, particularly concerned states to regularly consult the Secretariat and troop and police contributing countries.
Most of the penholders are in the hands of the Permanent members or the P3, but all council members can actually work as penholders or carry out the function of penholders.
The process remains an informal one, although this has been codified in note 507.
And a final point I wanted to mention is about mandate duration in Security Council mandates.
While most mandates, I think the large majority, particularly those pertaining to peace operations and sanctions regimes, are set for a period of one year.
Others are renewed and reviewed.
At longer for example UNOCCA, UNAWAS, these are regional offices and the 1267 monitoring team.
They will be renewed every three years and CTET every four years.
You also have a number of mandates that have a shorter intervals undof the peacekeeping operation every six months and a number of Other mandates remain, including several peacekeeping operations open ended, as well as some of the sanctions measures.
Open ended peace operations are anmo, gib, anso, anmic, UNRCCA and Anschol sanctions measures, Al Shabaab, Al Qaeda and Yemen and as well as the committees of Guinea Bissau and Iraq, they remain open ended.
I leave it at that.
Co Chairs, thank you again for inviting us.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank Ms. Bands Excellencies, colleagues.
I know that time is now limited for questions.
We have just about 13 minutes to go, so we ask that the questions are succinct to allow for everyone who wants to pose their questions to do so.
We thought it was important for you to hear practical examples of review mechanisms that are already in place across the UN system and good practices that we can contemplate as we go through our process.
I will now give the floor to the distinguished PR of Norway.

**Norway | PR**

Thank you very much.
You've certainly given us a lot to think about, also how this reflects and plays into mandate creation.
But I was struck about something you said, Ilse, about the Human Rights Council.
If I didn't misunderstand you, and I hope I didn't, I heard that many of the human rights mandates have clauses for review, but that they almost automatically leads to renewal.
And that makes me wondering what the sort of mechanics of the review is, what kind of discussions take place, what kind of reporting or what kind of background does the Council have then to sort of almost automatically renew the mandates?

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Thank you.
I thank Norway.
I give the floor now to the distinguished PR of Singapore.

**Singapore | PR**

Thank you very much.
Co Chairs, very useful briefing indeed for all of us.
I have actually many questions in my.
Mind.
But let me start perhaps with a question relating to cost.
When we establish a mandate, there's clearly a cost dimension in terms of a PBI being required.
But when we renew a mandate.
Or. Put it in a default mode where it goes through every year, is there a way of quantifying the cost of not doing a review or not retiring a mandate?
So my point is that there is a cost for action, but is there a way of quantifying the cost for inaction in terms of mandate review and renewal?
I think it's important to make this information available at some point so that delegations who are sovereign indeed, as was pointed out by several of the briefers, will have the relevant information to make decisions in an intergovernmental context.
Second point, also a question.
Is there a way the Secretariat can share actually how many mandates have actually been retired over the last 80 years and in what areas of the three pillars, have these retired mandates taken place?
I mean, obviously the Security Council has a very structured process and it's a much smaller body.
The Human Rights Council, also much smaller than the General Assembly.
Aquasoc as well, has a structured process.
The General assembly, because these larger struggles with creating a structured process.
But I think it will be good to see how many mandates have been retired over the last 80 years, in which principal organs and under which pillars.
And a related question, how many retired mandates have come back on the agenda or to a new mandate?
The reason I ask that question is that it's important to have a permeable system where mandates can be created and retired with fluidity, because right now a lot of delegations would be very concerned about retiring a mandate, because that may be the death of a certain issue.
But we want to create a more fluid situation that mandates can be renewed or retired.
It could come back very quickly if needed, so that we assure delegations that retiring mandate is not the end of an issue, but it could be a phase or it could be a pause.
That's the second comment and question.
My third question relates to consolidated reviews.
I think USGuy Rider was talking about how consolidated reviews the exception rather than the norm.
And could the Secretariat suggest a clustering of agenda items that could potentially be reviewed in a consolidated way in the future and present this to the consideration of Member States?
We can then look at it.
Either disagree with the Secretariat clustering, but I think the idea of a consolidated review of clusters of items with a view to just starting the review process, I think it's an important one.
My last comment and question.
I'm sorry, I think it was the presentations which have generated a lot of questions in my mind, relates to mandates which are minimally active.
Obviously, a lot of mandates are being renewed for a variety of reasons.
Politically, there is a need, there's a sense of urgency around certain issues, and some issues are just intractable, they need a longer time.
But if the level of activity is so minimal as to create an implementation deficit, to quote the words of the Assistant Secretary General here on the podium, then the question arises for Member States if the implementation deficit, because the activity is so minimal, Member States are confronted with the question, either we provide additional resources or we retire the mandate, or we put in a serious way of reviewing how we do something.
Again, that decision has to be made by Member States.
So my question to the Secretariat is whether the Secretariat will be able to identify a list of mandates that in its view, in the Secretariat's view, faces a minimal level of activity and therefore suggests that there is considerable implementation deficit and therefore requires the review of members to take a decision either to provide additional resources or to restructure the way the mandates are designed or to retire the mandate.

**Singapore | Representative**

So these are some questions and comments.
Thank you very much co chairs.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank Singapore.
I now give the floor to Australia.

**Australia | Representative**

Thank you very much indeed co chairs.
And can I thank each of our briefers?
It's really been a most valuable and instructive morning.
I have two very quick questions.
The first is really straightforward and it very much builds on guys briefing I think concerning what we do in the review space.
I wonder whether there are potential examples of best practice review clauses out there because I do think when we think about how to go forward and really to build on Berhan's comments just a moment ago, when we're looking at review processes obviously budget is key but actually some really straightforward simple examples that are plug and play examples I think is what will help us make a difference.
And that goes also I think to the notion of model resolutions, model mandate text to streamline processes.
I had a second reflection when I listened to the OHCHR briefing for which I'm deeply grateful.
Obviously in the human rights space where.
We spend such a small amount of.
Our budget on human rights and yet the nature of the work done is so important and the nature of the mandates in the human rights space is so important, I think we should have a think about what's the link between the mandates we have in the human rights space, our spend and the results.
So I think it goes to those three interrelated issues which go very much to what many of us have been.
Talking about this morning.
So I I'd be interested in what that looks like.
Thanks so much.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank Australia.
I give the floor to the European Union.

**EU | Representative**

Thank you.
Thank you co chairs and thanks also for the briefers for their updates and I think there's already a lot of good practices out in the system as it is just to confirm that in our view this reform should of course eventually result in a consolidation, streamlining and updating of existing mandates.
And as well we know there are quite many and that includes an identification of mandates that have outlived their original purpose or completed their objectives.
So what evidence based framework could we implement to align mandate reform with performance management?
So I think what I'm asking is how can we measure impact?
What role do we foresee for the pact for the future in that?
Because that of course as we have been saying for A while is the what so how can we, how can we align the, you know, the impact assessment with that what system wide mandate can we system wide standard can we put in place for the review and should it be system wide or should it be organ specific, depending on which body of the UN adopted the mandate in the first place.
We also have a question relating to external stakeholders.
We feel there should be a place for external stakeholders in the review.
But how is the Secretariat envisaging that if they were to develop sort of a review system for us or come with proposals.
And finally on the Secretariat's commitment to enhancing communication and also involving digital platforms and tools.
We appreciate that.
And this concerns the facilitation of the identification of duplications, cross citations, similarities among mandates.
We'd like to receive more details on that and on the concrete solutions that the Secretariat is thinking about and maybe also on that a technical briefing in the in the near future.
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the European Union.
I give the floor to Liechtenstein to be followed by Malawi and then Costa Rica.

**Liechtenstein | Representative**

Liechtensteinstein, thank you very much.
Co chairs, all protocol observed and many thanks to our panelists.
Nonetheless on costing, I mean we have talked about this before.
We think there should be a casting of every resolution, be it a new mandate or a renewed mandate.
So I think that's similar to what.
Our colleague from Singapore has said, has said before and that of course can also be looking back that we have an indication of how much the implementation has cost in the previous implementation period.
I'm also curious if we can maybe because I think we're thinking in a way about the toolkit and about measures for the future.
So thinking if there are attributes of mandates that we can identify that help us decide whether something requires a shorter or longer mandate review and along similar lines and I think echoing what our colleague from the U has just said can have indicators or benchmarks to, to measure impact but also relevance of mandates in the future also I mean there.
Was a little bit on this on.
The panel, but are there sort of recognized best practices in integrating review mechanisms during the initial mandate design phase?
Thank you so much.
Much.
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Liechtenstein.
I give the floor now to Malawi, then Costa Rica and then South Africa.

**Malawi | Representative**

Chair considering that and thank you for the briefers.
Considering that the world has become more dynamic and complex from social, political and economic perspectives.
The mandate review mechanisms that have been shared appear to be more from within, from inside.
And it looks right at.
The existing processes and existing themes.
And I'm happy to hear Indonesia has.
Touched on what I'm trying to ask for the consolidated review of classes.
And then there is another, I think.
It was another country has asked about.
The evidence based mandate review.
My point is that the world out there has of late queried the relevance and impact of the un and this means that the social contract that the world has had with the UN has.
Been eroded over time.
So how can we make sure that the review, the mandate review is really taking into account these issues that are happening, the changes that are happening in.
A more consolidated way rather than in a fragmented way.
Because from what we have heard, everybody is doing it in their own silos.
But probably at this time with UN80 initiative, we need a more consolidated and more overview, a more ego approach to this mandate review.
Thank you very much.
Thank you Malawi.
I give the floor to Costa Rica and then South Africa.

**Costa Rica | Representative**

Thank you Cal Chairs, we appreciate the brief.
First, insights on the many nuances of.
Mandate review on this topic allow me.
To make some questions.
The first one is what practices from bodies other than the General assembly should be brought to the General Assembly?
Second, what efforts do the Secretaries of bodies other than the GA make to streamline mandates?
And third, how can Member States help.
Strengthen the role of secretariats?
As a final comment, we need to acknowledge that is urgent to learn from.
Across the system like principles and actions.
Need to be system wide.
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank Costa Rica. I give the floor to South Africa.

**South Africa | Representative**

Thank you co Chairs and thank you.
To the panelists for the information provided this morning.
South Africa has a few questions concerning the mandate review process.
The first question relates to the report which states that more than 85% of active mandates lack instructions on review or termination?
South Africa has in our previous deliberations raised the importance of the inclusion of sunset clauses in this regard.
Should the inclusion of expiry clauses and review advisories not become standard in the stage of mandate design?
Secondly, if a results based management mechanism is a measure is to measure accountability as well as the impact and collective achievement of our mandates, our core preoccupation of this discussion, would it not be crucial to have an effectively run uniform system wide performance management mechanism firmly in place to also evaluate the impact of activities?
Thirdly, while South Africa agrees with the proposed solutions for system wide mandate reviews, should the use of such mechanisms not also include mention of the Joint Inspection Unit and the Committee for Program and Coordination?
Finally, in setting up a harmonized system wide performance management mechanism, what would be the annual budgetary and human resource implications of ensuring the availability of consistent and predictable resources for the operationalization of Such a mechanism.
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank South Africa.
I give the floor to Mexico and then Qatar.

**Mexico | Representative**

Thank you very much.
All protocols observed.
Thank you for the very important briefing and I would like to pose three quick questions.
The report indicates that over 80%, 85% of active mandates lack clear instructions for review or termination.
Could the Secretariat elaborate on the practical obstacles that prevent the systematic inclusion of review benchmarks or sunset clauses and how Member States might support the establishment of a more predictable review architecture?
Another one is While several entities have advanced their result based management practices, significant variations persist across the system.
So what steps are envisioned to harmonize methodologies and ensure comparability and coherence in performance reporting?
And finally, the inclusion of expiration clauses for new mandates is identified as a best practice in the Secretariat's assessment.
What categories of mandates would be most suitable for the introduction of sunset clauses and how might this practice be gradually expanded?
Thank you very much.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank Mexico.
I give the floor to Qatar and then China.

**Qatar | Representative**

Thank you very much.
I'd like to thank the Co Chairs for their leadership of this transparent, inclusive process and for all the briefers for their very informative information that they provided us with.
So we engage in this mandate implementation review and exercising that enhancing coherence, reducing deployment, application and streamlining.
Our first question would be regarding the practical tools available to improve the efficiency of our work across the Main Committees.
Under the provision of paragraph 28A of resolution 79 327, the General assembly plenary first takes all required votes individually on draft resolutions or parts where a vote occurred in the Main Committee and only thereafter adopts and one gavel all other resolutions and decisions that were approved in the Committee without a vote?
Could the mandate implementation review explore whether this approach, adopting all non contested draft resolutions in a single action during the Plenary could be expanded or applied more systematically across the Main Committees?
In particular, could it help reduce repetitive procedural steps, minimize scheduling burdens during the plenary adoption period and support a more streamlined, predictable and efficient resolutions?
Second question is on the relevance and coherence of existing mandates across the Main Committees.
How will the mandate implementation review identify mandates that remain relevant, those that require updating or consolidation, and those that may no longer contribute effectively to the work of the organization to guide Member States in assessing application of efforts?
Mandates that predate major frameworks such as the 2030 Agenda, mandates whose output puts no longer translate into impactful results and proposals that add to procedural burden without advancing shared priorities.
Coaches Guitar looks forward to supporting your leadership and continuing this important exercise.
Thank you I thank Qatar, I give the floor to China and then Finland.

**China | Representative**

Thank you Co Chairs.
I thank the briefers for their insightful briefings.
I have three questions.
First, effective assessment of the mandate delivery is a basis for mandate review.
So how does the UN system or.
Is planning to measure the relevant progress and results?
What are the key dimensions and quantitative indicators used in such assessments?
The second question is with regard to a suggestion made in the SG report which is make full use of the existing mechanism to streamlining mandates.
So how many specific outputs has SG recommended to terminate over the 80 years?
What are the selecting criteria for such inputs and why are the reasons.
What are the reasons why this mechanism is not very often used?
The third is with regard to Security Council.
This year in March, Security Council has successfully done a streamlining of Council meetings.
What has GATT done in facilitating such streamlining process?
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank China, floor to Finland and then latvia.

**Finland | Representative**

Thank you Mr. Chair.
In particular, I wish to thank you for a very useful mandate source registry provided by the Secretariat.
Now, inspired by your presentation and in particular by the presentation by Executive Director Inger Andersen of unep, could a similar interactive result dashboard on mandate implementation progress be provided by 2ease member state review of mandates?
This should optimally also include information about resource use.
Once mandate is nearing completion of expected outcomes or when no progress is being made, relevant body could be triggered to consider review, recalibration or retirement of the mandate.
This would enhance transparency to Member States.
Now, for obvious reasons, when considering systematic mandate reviews, we need to also recognize the diversity of mandates, their nature, size and expected duration.
And I'm thinking here notably about the mandates under the Human Rights Pillar, as was very well presented by the ESG of ohcr.
Thank you very much.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Thank you Finland.
I give the floor to Latvia to be followed by the Republic of Korea.

**Latvia | Representative**

Thank you to Co Chairs for convening this important session.
Also thank you to all briefers for their comprehensive briefings.
This is very valuable and important.
Allow me to ask three following questions.
First, one on mandate review coherence across the UN system.
Some similar questions were asked by EU delegation and Costa Rica.
But in addition to that, having experience of both co chairing the ECOSOC HLPF review process as well as chairing the Force Committee in the previous session, we consider that coherence and follow through is of great importance among all UN organs in regards to mandate review.
In your view, what are the key aspects of possible coordination to ensure coherence and follow through across the whole UN system?
Second, on the role of the General Committee.
General Committee has an advantage of its cross cutting nature.
Could we use this Committee to pursue efforts at optimizing the mandate system and the final one on Main Committee's mandate cycle mandates usually being created well in advance of the session and this leaves the future chairs in a predetermined position without much of autonomy.
Could how this could be addressed in order to equip Chairs with some tools to be able to influence work of.
The Committee in session.
Thank you.
I thank Latvia I give the floor to the Republic of Korea and then Malaysia.

**Korea, Republic of | Representative**

Thank you Chair for this opportunity.
I will have a quick question question on scad can you elaborate on how Security Council has substantially reduced and consolidated agenda numbers and how do you manage it to keep it that way?
Maybe we can learn some lessons from in terms of methodology and also another question is Secretary General has already authority to recommend to the General Assembly a list of outdated deliverables for discontinuation.
I wonder whether we can operationalize or reactivate this process as a feedback to the membership.
So do you see any obstacle or reluctance or no incentives for the Secretariat to do so?

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Thank you.
I thank the Republic of Korea.
I give the floor to the final Speaker.
Malaysia.

**Malaysia | Representative**

Thank you Co Chair.
Thank you to the briefers.
I'll be Brief in my one question.
For USG Rider it relates to paragraph 60 of the Secretary General's report on the Mandate Implementation Review.
Specifically, I'd like to focus on the review regarding the Secretary General's Special Envoys under work package number 11, I believe under the Action Plan.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

My question is what is the scope.
Of this review and when will this review be presented to Member States?
Thank you so much.
Thank you Malaysia Colleagues, we have heard the last speaker on the list of speakers for this meeting.
As we previously announced, the next meeting will take place on the 3rd of December and we will of course as usual send a letter in advance of that meeting.
We will remain available to meet with Working Group members or hear from you via the Co Chair's email which has been previously disseminated.
Thank you so much to our briefers and thank you to you for persevering with us today.
We look forward to seeing you on Wednesday of next week.
The meeting is adjourned.
