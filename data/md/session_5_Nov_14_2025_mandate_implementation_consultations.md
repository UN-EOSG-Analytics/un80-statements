# Session 5 | Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 1 (Nov 14, 2025) 

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

Good morning.

Good morning, colleagues.

May I invite you to take your seats?

It.

Good morning.

I call to order the informal meeting of the Working Group for consultations on the matter of mandate implementation.

On behalf of Ambassador Schwarger, I warmly welcome all of you to today's consultations on mandate implementation under the ongoing UNAT review process.

We begin by recognizing the presence of Mr. Guy Ryder, under Secretary General for Policy and chair of the UN 80 task force his Excellency Christian Venavesso, Permanent representative of Liechtenstein Mr. Martin Kimani, President and Chief Executive Officer of the African center and former Permanent Representative of Kenya and who is joining us virtually along with Mr. Meera Haq, former United Nations Under Secretary General for the Department of Field Support, former co Chair of the High Level Independent Panel on Peace Operations and former Secretary General Special Representative for Timor Lest and Head of the United Nations Integrated Mission in East Timor.

The objective of this session is to collectively reflect on the insights and recommendations emerging from the Mandate implementation briefing on 30 October and to identify concrete next step that can enhance efficiency, transparency and accountability in how mandates are implemented across the United nations system.

We welcome views on the recommendations made on mandate implementation in the Secretary General's report, as well as any additional proposals Working Group members may wish to put forward themselves.

We aim to foster a shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities inherent in mandate implementation, strengthen coordination among entities and ensure that our collective efforts are guided by the principles of effectiveness, inclusivity and results oriented delivery in support of the organization's overarching goals.

In this vein, we wish to reassure Member States that we have taken careful note of the valuable recommendations provided to the Working Group thus far.

We reiterate the importance of maintaining a collaborative and inclusive approach with the full engagement of all Member States to ensure a process that is both effective and transparent.

Our shared objective remains to achieve the highest possible level of ambition.

By the conclusion of this exercise, we aim to inspire fresh, pragmatic and innovative thinking that strengthens the culture of mandate design and implementation across the United nations system.

As we continue our engagement in this discovery phase, we hope to deepen our collective understanding of mandates, guided by empirical evidence, analytical insights and lessons drawn from best practices across the United nations system.

There appear to be some emerging areas of common interest that we have discerned from the consultations and discussions to date.

It is our intention to elaborate on those when we provide our Interim report to you on December 11th and in our subsequent communications to you ahead of our work on the Production phase, which will begin in Mid January.

We look forward to hearing more from you today.

As we look at mandate implementation.

Today, Working Group members will first hear responses to questions posed at the Mandate implementation briefing on 30 October.

As you're aware, answers provided by the Secretariat were shared under cover of a letter from the co chairs on the 12th of November and these will also be made available on the UN80 Initiative website.

Additionally, as advised in that letter, Working Group members will have the opportunity today to express their their views on mandate implementation and we look forward to hearing your ideas and proposals.

We invite you please to submit your interventions as well as any additional inputs by uploading these to the Edelegate portal, as well as sending these to us in writing via our email address@unity mandates.co chairs Gmail.

As expressed in our last meeting, we intend to compile and publish the contributions of Working Group members on the UNAT Initiative website unless otherwise indicated by you.

Your inputs will contribute to building a comprehensive picture of how we might better tackle mandates in the future.

I now pass the floor to my co Chair, Ambassador Schwalgo.

**IAHWG | Carolyn Schwalger | Co-Chair**

Thank you.

Good morning, everybody.

Before we turn to the questions posed to the briefers, we just wanted to take this opportunity to share that as Co Chairs, we have recently held engagements with the presidents of the Boards and leadership teams of several UN funds, programs and agencies to deepen our understanding of how the issue of mandate creation, implementation and review is being considered in their organisations and what this could mean for the Working Groups, development, deliberations and approach going forward.

We have also been meeting with the Chairs of the Main Committees and the co facilitators of the GA revitalization process to ensure that we understand their operating context and any implications for this Working Group.

We also wish to inform members of the Working Group that we, as Co Chairs, will hold a meeting on 19 November in coordination with the Executive Office of the Secretary General, to hear directly from UN system entities on their experiences with mandate implementation and to exchange views on how the review can be made more meaningful and impactful.

In particular, we will focus on strengthening UN system engagement and exploring how analytical work can best support the deliberations of this Working Group.

We also plan to travel to Geneva and Vienna in early January to undertake further consultations with Member States and UN system entities there.

So it is now my honour to offer the floor to our briefers, who will provide additional answers to Questions posed at the 30 October briefing on Mandate implementation.

First, I give the floor to Mr. Guy Ryder, under Secretary General, for Policy to further elaborate on the answers provided to Member States in the form of visual illustrations and follow up to the many questions raised during the recent briefing on mandate implementation.

Floor is yours.

Thank you.

**UN Secretariat | Guy Ryder | USG Policy**

In the first instance, Ambassador Schwalger, Ambassador Wallace, thank you for this opportunity to be one of the briefers in today's session of the Working Group.

And more than that, thank you for the extraordinary leadership you're providing in the work of the Working Group.

And I think the attendance in the room this morning is evidence of the very strong engagement of Member States in the important work you are carrying out.

Now.

Let me say that it is important that we do continue to work together on the discussion of the overall life cycle approach to mandates that we are basing our work upon.

Focusing today, of course, most particularly on the delivery stage of the life cycle.

Do I have graphics on the screen?

I do.

Can I give you some perhaps context to the discussion today?

As has been mentioned by Ambassador Wallace, we shared some written responses to the questions raised at the session of 30th of October.

You have received them and I don't think it would be a useful use of your time to repeat what is in those responses.

So instead I can perhaps use this time to highlight what seemed to us to be some of the key points that we shared and provide just a little bit of context in some areas that may be of relevance.

I want to begin by underlining why the work that is being done here is so critically important, why it is essential that we streamline and strengthen the UN system's mandate delivery.

If we take a look at our resource situation, you look at the graphic ahead of us.

It's not a new graphic.

You can see that we are projecting that resources across the entirety of of the United nations systems might well shrink by as much as 25% in 2026 next year compared to the levels of 2024.

And I think that provides a very clear message to us that we simply must focus on optimizing processes, eliminating duplications, if we are to continue to serve the people who need our assistance most.

Let me then turn to some more specific aspects in relation to mandate delivery, which is the focus of today's session.

The first point that I could perhaps make relates to reports.

Let me again draw your attention to two statistics, two numbers that we've already shared, but is perhaps worth lingering on again.

If you look at this graphic, you will see that a total of 66% of reports cover recurring topics.

Topics have come on, come back again and again, and 46% of our reports are produced either annually or more frequently than annually.

So if you look at the red boxes here, you will see that those two boxes up to 46%, sort of.

In very plain terms, this means that we are spending considerable time and resources writing reports on the same or similar issues in successive years.

And of course, in many cases, this is absolutely necessary and appropriate.

We understand that annual updates are often appropriate and necessary, but that does not or should not disguise the possibility that there may be opportunities to optimize the format, the length or the periodicity of certain reports.

I cannot claim that the statistics before you are conclusive, but they are certainly suggestive.

On the other hand, and in some instances, to preserve both Member States bandwidth and respect, that and the Secretariat's capacity, it might be worth considering whether some reports could shift to a biannual or even longer cycle of publication.

That's reports.

Let's move on to funding issues.

Colleagues, on funding, the graphic before you shows that the UN system's work relies on very heavily on voluntary contributions.

Roughly 80% of our total resources are from voluntary contributions, and therefore only 20 are derived from assessed funding of any kind.

This also shows that the UN Secretariat accounts for only a relatively small share of overall system resources.

Most UN system funding, and therefore most delivery, takes place outside the Secretariat across funds, programs and specialized agencies.

And this level of voluntary funding dependence means that the way that voluntary funding is provided its predictability, its flexibility, or its earmarking has a major impact on how effectively we can deliver on the mandates that you hand to us.

The other dimension of this consideration concerns the size of the grant packages, the funding packages that we get.

I think it is noteworthy that 63% of our grants are for amounts below $1 million.

This funding comes in small packages.

A large share of our funding is delivered in these many small transactions, and each of these naturally carries with it its own administrative requirements.

And inevitably, the consequence is of a high administrative cost per individual grant compared with larger grants, consolidated contributions.

This is a situation which raises the level of overhead costs.

In addition, in past years there has been declining support for pooled funds.

Less than 10% of voluntary funding came through pooled funds in development and humanitarian action.

And that is far below the target established in the Funding Compact, which was a target of 30%.

The target was 30%.

The reality is 10%.

And here too is an area where it would be extremely valuable if this Working group could take a closer look at remedial action.

May I?

Also, without going beyond that, I'm conscious of the need not to do so beyond the boundaries of the work of of this Working Group.

Draw your attention to proposals which are included in Work Stream 3, the report on Workstream 3 that was published by the Secretary General shortly before High Level Week, which relate to this topic.

For your reference, they are in paragraphs 97 to 101 of the Secretary General's Report on Workstream 3. I think you will notice from this that there is a clear area this is a clear area where Work Streams two and three do converge.

In our Work Stream two report, we have identified specific challenges to mandate delivery, and in Work Stream 3, we try to identify specific avenues to address the challenges in terms of our structures and our programs.

In the meeting on the 30th of October, several of you asked how we can address issues of fragmentation in our delivery.

Issues of fragmentation and duplication have been recurring issues in our Work Stream 3 report.

To reference it again, we provided some avenues to address fragmentation, such as scaling up common services, creating a single entry point for macroeconomic analysis, and establishing joint knowledge hubs.

But generally speaking, we need to assess where different UN entities have a comparative advantage and how they can work together to leverage those comparative advantages to best effect.

And one way to approach that challenge is to look at what particular function an entity fulfills.

In the graphic before you, we list some of the big categories of function, normative support, policy advice, data and statistics, capacity building, convening, service delivery and support, and other functions.

What we are trying to get to through this lens is where each part of the UN system can deliver on the aspect of a mandate that it is best equipped to handle with clear divisions of labor, which would help to eliminate dangers of duplication.

If that sounds rather abstract, let me just try to give an example to illustrate the point.

It's an example taken simply because it does illustrate the point, rather than for any other reason, the issue of global vaccination program.

So the WHO provides the normative and technical guidance and policy advice, setting the global standards for childhood vaccinations, and working with governments on how to translate global vaccination goals, international public health plans.

That's one function.

Gavi, not strictly part of the UN system, supports the funding function, and UNICEF in turn focuses on support functions such as procurement to vaccine delivery on the ground, working with your national health authorities to reach families and children to deliver the vaccinations.

And here you see what might at first sight look like duplication is in fact a very efficient and complementary division along functional complementary functional lines.

In this way, UN entities play Complementary, not duplicative, roles, ensuring that together we can deliver the greatest possible impact.

So, co chairs, those were some of the additional clarifications that I wanted to share.

I hope they're helpful to you and of course I look forward to listening to your statements and to our continued conversations around the UN systems Mandate delivery.

Thank you very much.

**IAHWG | Carolyn Schwalger | Co-Chair**

Thank you.

Very helpful.

Thank you.

Under Secretary General Ryder, I now give the floor to His Excellency Christian Venavesa, Permanent Representative of Liechtenstein.

We're particularly interested in hearing from you on which measures you would prioritise to improve mandate impact and any thoughts you might have on reporting, given that came up very frequently and the mandate implementation briefing and of course, any of the other questions that were posed.

The floor is yours.

**Liechtenstein | Christian Wenaweser | PR**

Great. Thank you so much.

It's very good to be back.

And again, big thanks to you for steering this process in such a structured and transparent way.

I think people know that the questions asked were mostly asked to the Secretariat and that will not take up that much time for that reason.

And you've already heard extremely helpful replies from Guy Ryder and I will focus on on what Carolyn has just mentioned.

In particular, measures to improve impact and efficiency across the system.

As far as mandates, as you know from my briefing, I strongly believe that we should put more efforts into crafting our mandates very carefully.

And I think that would be my biggest wish and my most important suggestion.

So there has to be consultation.

There have to be consultations, not just among ourselves states, but also with the relevant parts of the Secretariat, which honestly will help us to just understand what we are doing and what we are proposing.

And in particular, if we are proposing something that is perhaps already done or in part already done.

So we do believe that a consultation on substance, but also on procedure and on whether something is legally sound is extremely important to craft good mandates and to also have an understanding of what the implementation of a mandate will cost.

So we believe every resolution should be costed and that we should, before making a decision on how we express ourselves on a proposed new mandate, that we know the financial aspect of a decision.

Linked to this is the question of reporting that you have also flagged.

Carolyn, as you know, I think the first question for us should be do we need a report?

Because we do not believe that every resolution does need a report.

The report can be extremely important and can be big value added.

But that is not the case always.

And right now, I think mentally we are in a sort of space of automaticity.

You have a resolution, so you need an SG report.

So I think we need to rethink that and look at this, at this differently.

Then also think about, well, perhaps it's good to have a report at the beginning to frame a conversation and to give us a real basis to take a topic forward.

But maybe as we move ahead in the delivery of a mandate, and Guy has made it very clear in his comments how many reports are on regularly recurring topics and maybe the moment will come where the membership has sufficient information or is sufficiently served with being provided additional information and things that have changed.

There are in fact reports that consist mainly of submissions by Member States.

These reports tend to be extremely duplicative and repetitive.

Sometimes they're very lengthy.

These are probably reports, we don't need it all anymore.

But again, it should be something that we look at as proponents of mandates, but also as those who are consulted and as part of the negotiations.

The periodicity is also something that is best looked at at the very beginning if you propose a new mandate.

I think, again, this sort of reflex to say we do this every year because I think it's important is not necessarily, I mean, I don't think that is actually accurate.

I think it can have an extremely important mandate that is, that is discussed only three or five years.

And that is something we should think about when we, when we draft our mandates.

And this is linked also a little bit on impact, but also on the question, what are we doing here?

Is this forward looking, is this backward looking?

So certainly we would hope that we will have a much better toolbox for ourselves as we move ahead in our work, as we move forward, as we start crafting new mandates, as of course we will and as we have to, and that we implement the measures that are being discussed here, but that will also allow us to do it with already existing mandates because they typically come back.

So if we embrace a new way of doing this and if we embrace new best practices, of course that can then be applied also, also to mandates as they, as they come back and as we resubmit or renew them.

So that is probably it for me.

And thanks for having me.

It's a great pleasure to offer my comments.

**IAHWG | Carolyn Schwalger | Co-Chair**

Thank you.

That's really helpful as well.

We now give the floor to Mr. Martin Kamani, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Africa center and former Permanent Representative of Kenya, to respond to the question posed to him during the briefing on mandate implementation.

And for your memory, that question read, to what extent, extent can the UN utilize AI for information or knowledge management and what is needed to become future ready?

And Martin of course, you're very welcome to share any brief reactions to any of the other questions posed as well.

Floor is yours.

**Martin Kimani | President & CEO**

Thank you very much.

VR and Board Chairs, thank you for inviting me once again to deliberate with you on this important topic for this important working group.

You asked to what extent the UN can utilize AI for information and knowledge management and what is needed for the organization to become future ready, and I will draw on the remarks that I shared on 30 October which outlined the UN structural knowledge problem and the cost it imposes on implementation.

As I briefed you then, the UN is rich in knowledge, yet staff and delegations rarely have that knowledge at the moment of decision.

This weakens implementation, slows crisis response, and forces the system to relearn what it already knows.

AI cannot replace political judgment, conflict, understanding or diplomacy, but it can remove the friction that consumes staff time and attention.

And this is where the opportunity lies.

A significant share of UN work is mechanical and rule based.

Administrative processing, financial workflows, indicator management, translation support, document retrieval, data cleaning, structured summaries and reference preparation.

These processes can be automated quite safely.

AI can also assemble inputs for higher level analysis.

It can retrieve resolutions, extract factual timelines, surface comparable cases and collate open source reporting.

These are repeatable tasks that do not require political sensitivity.

In fact, when Kenya was in the Security Council, we had a machine reading team in Nairobi that was doing just that, open source work that helped us a great deal in working on files where Kenya did not have a credible intelligence gathering system.

Automation in these areas expands the usable bandwidth of staff who must apply judgment.

It reduces the administrative burden that currently constrains the UN's ability to deliver and takes up so much of the financial resources.

The Political Call the UN must remain human.

Drafting the Secretary General's reports, the political analysis, the mandate interpretation that Christian was talking about, the conflict assessment, early warning, judgment negotiations, mapping of red lines, the way narratives are framed in complex and crisis situations.

These depend on contextual understanding and sensitivity to member state positions.

They require tacit knowledge acquired through experience and AI cannot perform these functions.

So the aim I was talking about last time, and as I repeat now, is reinforcement of political work, not its substitution.

Automation strengthens the UN core mandate in three ways.

First, deeper analysis.

Analysts gain more time for political consultation, reading and scenario testing when no longer required to reconstruct timelines or search for documents.

Early warning improves when staff focus on incentives, power dynamics and emerging risks.

Second, faster and clearer decisions.

Decision cycles accelerate when automated systems produce timelines, comparable cases, legal references, etc. Thirdly, diplomacy strengthens, negotiation improves when envoys have more time for bilateral consultations and political outreach.

Automated retrieval, past commitments, voting patterns and red lines frees you to have the energy to shape outcomes.

And especially this point is relevant to the smallest missions that struggle with the present workload.

So automation protects the space for human political judgment and therefore increases both delegations and Secretariat's capacity without expanding headcount.

We also have to respond to the new cyber threat environment.

The AI enabled cyber espionage campaign that was documented by Anthropic, which runs Claude AI.

If you use it.

This mid September, just a few weeks ago, marked a turning point.

For the first time it showed a state sponsored actor using an AI model to conduct reconnaissance, exploitation and essentially to undertake the attack at scale with minimal human oversight.

The operational cost for adversaries has dropped while the speed and automation of the attacks has increased.

The UN is exposed.

Its digital environment is fragmented, it's unevenly secured and it's filled with sensitive political and humanitarian data.

The risks are theft and contamination of its knowledge systems, disruption of mission communications, and of course, erosion of trust in its analysis.

So what's a realistic UN response?

I think that requires three actions as I close.

One, the UN has to harden its systems.

It has to establish a single minimum security standard across the Secretariat funds and programs.

And it has to focus on practical steps that reduce fragmentation in the UN's digital environment.

This is achievable with the SG's direction and your support financially in the fifth committee.

Second, it needs AI assisted threat detection.

And third, it needs support to Member States.

The UN should offer simple, cost effective cyber resilience packages to LDCs and fragile states.

These should include basic protection measures, guidance on secure digital services and help with incident response.

The UN cannot defend countries against every cyber threat, but it can raise the minimum level of security for those with the least resources.

And I highly recommend this to the LDCs and other developing states.

In terms of its workforce implications and the realistic constraints.

We know that AI will transform global labor markets.

We know that it will transform education systems and industrial strategies.

If the UN development system remains centered on project cycles and reporting, it will not meet what Member States need.

The UN will need more policy expertise in economics, education reform, labor market design, industrial transformation and digital governance that is aware and expert on AI.

And AI can support these experts with modeling and evidence synthesis.

The UN cannot compete with industry for elite AI engineers or cyber specialists, but it can bring in targeted expertise through second men's partnerships and short term consultancies.

It can also go further.

It can build a fellowship, something that we can call an AI core or some other name, which is a structured global fellowship program that would bring engineers, alignment researchers and cyber AI specialists into the UN for a period of time.

They would work on secure architecture, digital public goods and knowledge systems.

In return, they gain exposure to context they would never otherwise encounter.

I meet so many young people who would love to work at the un.

Give them that opportunity in the AI realm and I'm sure some top talent will come for some period of time.

This model would be realistic if it's funded by member states, philanthropies and universities perhaps, and it supplements political and development staff rather than replacing them.

So in closing, what's a future ready AI?

In quick point form?

It treats knowledge infrastructure as core institutional infrastructure.

It automates rule based and repetitive workflows.

It protects political functions as entirely human.

It modernizes cybersecurity to confront AI enabled threats.

It adjusts workforce composition towards technical and analytical expertise.

It establishes a standing experimentation unit with the authority to test and iterate.

It anchors regional pilots in Africa where most nexus contexts lie.

It publishes evidence on gains in search, retrieval speed, analysis time and decision speed.

In conclusion, AI will not solve political disagreements or compensate for unclear mandates.

It will not replace diplomacy, conflict analysis or negotiation.

But it can remove mechanical burdens that limit the UN's capacity to act.

It can expand the time available for human judgment which is at the heart of conflict prevention and crisis response.

It can harden the organizations against the new threat landscape and strengthen its service to member states.

I think you have the chance to build a UN that can do all these things that I have spoken about and I encourage you in the working group to recommend a piloting of these approaches as soon as possible.

Measure the effect and scale what the evidence supports.

Thank you.

**IAHWG | Carolyn Schwalger | Co-Chair**

Thanks Martin.

You've deeply thought about these issues and I really appreciate, and I'm sure Brian does too, the clarity of the recommendations you've put in front of us as well.

We'd now like to invite Ms. Amirah Hark, former United Nations Under Secretary General for the Department of Field Support Support, to provide an answer to a couple of questions that were in her field.

One of those questions relates to how can system wide coordination mechanisms such as the ceb, un, sdg, IASC be used to improve coherent mandate implementation?

And the other question is what drives so many entities to spread themselves so thin across so many mandates?

And how can better coordination reduce competition for resources?

And of course you're also welcome to share any brief reactions to other questions posed.

The floor is yours.

**Amirah Haq | Former USG DFS**

Thank you very much.

In response to the first question, in terms of system wide coordination mechanisms, I mean, there is absolutely, I think, no debate whatsoever on the need for coordination mechanisms.

But I think where we need to investigate the time, the transactional costs that are incurred in these mechanisms is the key question.

So coordination mechanisms absolutely necessary at the level of CEB and the UNSDG and iasc.

But I think when Guy was speaking, I, you know, noted that in the implementation he had written that, you know, we need to focus constantly on improving people's lives.

And you know, I can, I can sort of think of if we start each one of these meetings, numerous meetings and other mechanisms that we have in terms of saying, is the time spent, is the time that we're going to spend on this meeting.

What is the direct correlation of the time spent in this meeting to actually making an impact and improving someone's lives?

I think, you know, that kind of cross sectional analysis is very good in terms of, you know, how much time are we spending, to what effect and what are the actual results.

The second thing with respect to these coordination mechanisms and which I observed in the field, particularly when I was in the field in these coordination roles, is that what is discussed and agreed at headquarters doesn't necessarily find its way down to the field representatives.

So sometimes we have a situation where I think headquarters and the policy level feels quite, you know, satisfied that yes, we have made these kind of agreements and, you know, certain policies are in place.

But I think when you go down to the field level, sometimes at the field, the same kind of discussions which have already been agreed to at headquarters are taking place at the field level.

So there is that duplicative nature and that the decisions of headquarters not being transmitted in, I would have to say, in a rather forceful way to representatives on the ground to adhere to what has already been agreed.

And so there is a lot of repetitiveness and there's a lot of time spent again at the field level.

The third in terms of coordination mechanism is also the host government's role that the UN does not do this coordination, whether it's at the CEB or the UNSDG or iasc in isolation it is working.

It is in a host government.

And likewise there has to be a parallel mechanism at the host country level that accepts this.

So Guy made a very good example of Health and gavi.

But very often we would see that a ministry of, say, Maternal and Child Health doesn't necessarily, you know, adhere to something that has come from the planning ministry.

And so even at the host government level, there is sometimes a reluctance to come together, to assume a kind of coordination or a leadership maybe of one technical ministry.

So the UN in its coordination mechanisms has to have that translated at a host government, host nation level as well.

And that also proves one of the challenges of this system wide coordination.

And the last point that I would make on this is that member states who are providing the funding are also, you know, I think, bear some responsibility in terms of this fragmentation.

And, you know, I was struck by, by the number of grants that are below $1 million, because whether a grant is $1 million or below $1 million or $20 million or more, you know, the same level of administrative and other things, you know, Ambassador Kimani talked about, maybe AI can, you know, can take some of these, but, you know, it still requires the same amount of work because the accountabilities that are set in for a project or a program that is below $1 million is the same accountability of something that is $20 million.

So there again is where the transactional costs of these kinds of coordination mechanisms I think, have just gone way beyond, as I said, if we measure, what do all these levels of reports, meetings, discussions and everything else translate actually into improving people's lives?

So that is my few words on the system wide coordination.

As I said, it is absolutely necessary, but I think it can be streamlined.

I think it can be more disciplined.

I think there can be more, you know, reaching out to both member states who are providing funding and to the host nations where we are working to also embrace and, you know, try and work within these mechanisms in their respective sides.

The second question was, what drives so many entities to spread themselves so thin across many mandates?

And how can better coordination reduce competition for resources?

And when I read that question, I said, you know, the answer is actually in the, in the question itself because all entities, all UN entities are competing for limited number, limited amount of resources.

And that is why sometimes if again, to take the example of the health sector, but, you know, it applies equally if someone is doing the implementation and the, you know, the procurement, for example, of vaccines and all the, you know, equipment and other things that are required for it.

But if the, you know, the sort of the supply chain in terms of a policy within the government is not there, it's very difficult for the procurement to happen in isolation.

And so what happens is there is a tendency then for someone who wants to make sure that the vaccines are implemented and that go right down to the deep field where all this is so essential, they automatically want to get involved also in the policy, in the funding.

So it's very difficult.

Even though we may have specializations, it's very difficult to kind of separate that.

And the other thing that is so evident in the chart that was put up on the voluntary funding and the assessment funding is that, particularly when I was in the peacekeeping and peace operations, a lot of what came in the assist contributions should have been passed on to UN agencies who have the expertise and the experience and the knowledge of the country, you know, where they have been working for a long time.

And a lot could, could be done there.

It was, I think I mentioned that it was very, very difficult.

It is very difficult still to have that kind of passage between voluntary and assessed fundings again, you know, with, with having the chapeau of is this improving people's lives.

But what happens is that we get into more thinking about silos and accountabilities and being able to deliver on something in order to be able to attract resources.

So again, here I feel there are responsibilities, and in this context, I would say more with member states who are providing the funding.

In the PC peacekeeping world that I was in, there was a total disconnect between those members of the foreign affairs ministries who were working to prepare the implementation and for example, the ministries of planning or development, and others who needed to look at early recovery.

So sometimes we had, in different parts of the UN almost at the same time, resolutions of funding decisions that were taking that were, that were not coordinated within that member state itself.

And I think that's where, you know, a lot of improvement in, within the coordination mechanisms and this ability to have each entity spread themselves so thin, thinking that, okay, if I have this in this program, it'll attract a little more money from this member state, because that's one of their country's priorities, too.

And so you kind of, you're fitting what you're going to do based on where you might align yourself with a member state's priorities, other than looking at, again, that central thing of improving people's lives where we are present.

So I think it's difficult to see one element of a mandate in isolation and also the accountability sometimes become very difficult.

And I think that's why so many entities are spreading themselves thin just in order to be able to capitalize on the very limited resources that are available for this particular issue.

So thank you very much.

I'll leave it at that.

**IAHWG | Carolyn Schwalger | Co-Chair**

Thank you so much, Amira.

It's so helpful to be reminded of the realities on the ground, and so we've really appreciated having you as a briefer.

That now brings us to the end of the briefers responding to your questions, and I pass the floor back to Ambassador Wallace.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Thank you, Carolyn.

I now open the floor for Working Group members to share their views on mandate implementation.

We continue to look forward to hearing your ideas and proposals to make mandate implementation more efficient, effective and impactful.

As usual, delegations are asked to keep their interventions to five minutes for groups and three minutes for individual delegations, and I see already quite a number of delegations who are interested to speak, so we're going to ask you to be disciplined on maintaining the time.

I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Iraq on behalf of the Group of 77 and China

**Iraq | Representative | (G77 + China)**

Excellencies Co Chairs. Good morning.

I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the group of 77 and Chan at the House of the Group wishes to express its appreciation to the Co Chairs for convening this important discussion and for the informative briefing held on 30th October which provided valuable insights into this important topic.

The Group further extends its gratitude to the panelists for their insightful presentations and valuable contributions.

The Group emphasizes that mandates achieve impact only through effective implementation, often requiring concerted efforts across multiple entities and areas of work.

Reflecting the Organization's multidimensional and cross cutting nature, the Group reaffirms that the overarching goal of the UNAT Initiative is to make the United nations more agile, resilient and capable of delivering high quality and efficient services while eliminating redundancy and overlap in mandate implementation.

The Group notes proposals for a common administrative platform and merging several of ongoing entities, departments, offices under the UNAT Initiative, emphasizing that any such process should enhance mandates implementation and service delivery while remaining fully guided by intergovernmental oversight and the authority of Member States.

The Group believes that the successful implementation of mandates requires translating general aspirations into specific, measurable outcomes with clearly defined objectives.

It is therefore essential to engage closely with with the Secretariat, whose role should remain supportive in nature on the modalities of implementation while reaffirming the prerogative of Member States to define objectives and expected outcomes.

Co Chairs the Group recognized that artificial intelligence tools may offer advantages in identifying potential duplicative mandates and overlapping implementation across mandating bodies.

However, their use must be approached with caution given risks related to privacy, security, and the sensitive nature of intergovernmental work, as well as concerns about accuracy and transparency.

Any consideration of such tools should therefore ensure adequate safeguards and that budgetary implications remain imaginable in the current challenging financial context.

The Group considers it important to receive comprehensive information on the intergovernmental bodies that have established and overseen the implementation of specific mandates, including updates on the status of implementation and the underlining reasons for any non or partial implementation.

Such information would contribute to a clearer understanding of challenges and facilitate more informed discussions among Member States.

The Group also underscores the importance of ensuring that the Secretariat maintains a neutral and balanced role in mandate implementation.

It is essential that all entities act strictly in accordance with mandates approved by Member States.

The Group further calls for mandate implementation to be measurable and supported by a system wide evaluation mechanism.

A key component of this effort is the need to link mandate decisions with projected costs and to identify opportunities to enhance efficiency, coherence and accountability throughout the implementation process.

Co Chairs to conclude, the Group of 77 and China retreats a strong commitment to engage constructively in this process.

We emphasize that discussions to mandate implementation or mandate implementation must remain inclusive, transparent and efficient, ensuring full oversight and participation by all Member States.

I thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the G77 and China.

I give the floor now to the European Union.

**EU | Representative | (EU)**

Thank you, Mr. Co Chair and dear colleagues.

I delivered this statement on behalf of the EU and its Member States.

The candidate countries, Turkey, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Georgia, as well as Armenia, Monaco and San Marino, align themselves with this statement.

We thank the Co Chairs for your remarkable coordination of this Working Group.

We also would like to thank the Secretariat for the responses provided and for issuing a structured action plan to further consolidate the work on UN80 and establish a system wide framework for action.

On today's topic of mandate implementation, allow me to highlight the following three points to address the proliferation of meetings and reports.

The EU calls for a system wide review to reduce duplication and create efficiencies, limiting meetings and reports in number, length and frequency.

Take for example the First Committee, which managed to finish its work earlier than scheduled this year.

We encourage the streamlining and rationalization of mandated meetings and reporting requests, as well as any measures aimed at reducing repetition across organs and bodies and resources.

We fully support the proposal to produce shorter reports and to combine them wherever possible.

In this regard, the work on revitalization of the General assembly and its Committee, as well as reform efforts across other bodies, takes on added significance.

2 We recognize that misaligned funding modalities and resource fragmentation constitute a serious challenge for the effective implementation of UN mandates, especially in times of liquidity crisis.

Therefore, we support granting flexibility to the Secretariat for the allocation of resources across programs and regions when justified by operational priorities or crisis, and following the implementation of accountability frameworks regulated by clear criteria.

The EU also underlines the importance of applying the mutual commitments as agreed in the Funding Compact to strengthen the predictability, quality and transparency of financial contributions and the third point on the division of labor among UN entities.

This must be further clarified to avoid unnecessary duplication and functional overlaps.

To enhance coordination and information exchange, we support the strategic use of resources through existing system wide coordination platforms and the enhancement of interagency coordination to effectively manage mandate delivery.

Also in the field, the integration of open, transparent and trustworthy use of AI into the mandate registry to showcase substantial similarities, potential duplications, risks and overlaps is also something that we support.

We also welcome the integration of digital technologies aimed at modernizing the UN system through shared data platforms, digital dashboards and analytics, paired with human oversight and clear accountability frameworks.

Lastly, we also support a more adaptive approach to mandate implementation, implementation based on agility, exchange of best practices and measurable impact.

Implementation plans should allow for adjustments in methods, timelines or resource allocation in response to evolving contexts and evidence of impact.

Dear Colleagues, the UN AD initiative demands more than compartmentalized efforts.

It requires an ambitious and truly system wide approach across the Secretariat, organs, committees, agencies and Member States in order to ensure that reform outputs directly translate into more coherent, cost effective, impactful and field responsive operations.

Work streams may advance in parallel, but they are not isolated from one another and therefore we must make sure that they mutually inform each other.

We also encourage continuous coordination between our discussions on the mandate implementation review and other processes, including GA revitalization efforts, ongoing GA Committee work, and the review of working methods and information exchanges between the Secretariat and Member States.

In their capacities as members of the Boards of agencies, funds and programs, the European Union and its Member States stand ready to continue to contribute constructively to the next steps and I thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the European Union colleagues, I'm going to ask for your indulgence to allow me to use the Chair's prerogative to invite to depart from the group statements momentarily to allow our colleague Bob Ray of Canada to make what will be undoubtedly his actual final statement here before his actual imminent departure from New York.

Bob, you have the floor.

**Canada | Bob Rae**

I'm a little overwhelmed by the alacrity with which this has been done.

It really stems from a conversation that I had with Carolyn about her job and some of the challenges that we face.

And although I did give a farewell speech yesterday, this will be the last statement that I'll make.

The last, last one, I assure you.

And I don't want to take anything away from James, who is going to be giving the joint statement on behalf of Cans, which is.

Provides in greater detail and much more substance what I'm.

What I wanted to share with you.

I think we need to have the most honest dialogue we can about how this place works and doesn't work and what it's going to take to make it change.

And I really just want to encourage everyone to try in conversation and in discussion as much as possible, to actually engage in conversation and dialogue about what we need to do in private conversation.

I've noticed that everyone agrees that our work could be more productive, more pleasant and ultimately more impactful if we recognize that to a certain extent we're all caught up in simply doing a series of ritual activities which are there because they're ritual activities.

Now, to those who say we've got to go back to the basics of the Charter, let me remind everyone the Charter doesn't actually tell us all the things we the structure of meetings, how long mandates last for, whether we can change mandates, whether we can simplify processes.

None of that is in the Charter.

It's simply in the operational side of our decision making, which we can change and which we are free to change.

Changing the Charter is very difficult.

Changing our methods of work should not be difficult.

These are real time, real life decisions in the UN 80 process.

The three pillars that have been set up.

May produce some results, may produce some changes, but at the very least, we need to start from the premise that the reason we're having this conversation now in this way is because of money.

So if somebody says this has nothing to do with money, it has to do with money.

If it wasn't for the cuts that have been imposed on us by our funders Member States, we wouldn't be going through the changes that we're being asked to consider.

The mandates exercise, in my opinion, and I offer it only as an opinion, is exceptionally important part of this exercise because it speaks to the extent to which we have turned the methods of work into a kind of iconography.

We worship at the altar of these ways in which we do things without regard to whether we can afford it or whether it's actually useful.

And that speaks to everything that we do with respect to the volume of work which we generate and which we then ask the Secretariat in turn to generate.

I do not spend the day reading every report that's produced by the Secretariat and I would be very surprised if any of you did either.

Nor do any of us in reality take entirely at face value the extent to which our lives are dominated by a set of practices and rules which are arcane, outdated and could be changed.

And so I would encourage you to keep the faith in being as straightforward as possible in confronting the need for change.

And I would encourage the co chairs to continue with their ambition of trying to create as much real discussion as possible on the changes that are in fact possible.

We are the prisoners of our own making, but we each have a key to break the lock.

We just have to have the courage to find the key and use it and not be afraid of the fact that across various geographical groupings, ideological groupings, other divisions which exist among us, there's actually more consensus among us about the changes that we could make if we wanted to make them.

So I'm not here to offer you a magic plan or to say you must do this or that.

I'm only here to say that it's a mistake to think that this is another ritual exercise.

It's not.

Because unless the UN becomes more effective and impactful, it will become less relevant and we're the only ones who can actually change it.

The delegates of countries meeting together are the only people who can actually say, here are some things we must do to make the organization more relevant and more impactful.

And we can in fact do that.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Thank you.

Thank you, Bob and bon voyage.

I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Singapore on behalf of a group of states.

**Singapore | Representative | (Small States Group)**

Good morning colleagues.

Thank you very much.

Co chairs, it's always a challenge to speak after Ambassador Bob Ray.

We will miss his wisdom and eloquence and we wish him all the best.

Au reboire.

As we say to each other, colleagues, Co chairs, I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the Small States Group.

A cross regional grouping of small states comprising both developed and developing countries and a list of 53 countries have aligned with the statement.

And for the sake of efficient time management, we will make available the list of countries later to the Co Chairs Co Chairs the mandates are essentially an expression of the will and priorities of Member States.

Every mandate is a political commitment established with the expectation that it will be fully implemented.

Mandates should therefore be drafted in an informed and intentional manner and clearly articulated so that meaningful impact can be achieved through effective delivery.

Allow me to make three points on how mandate implementation can be improved.

First, strong knowledge management and effective use of technology can play an important enabling role in successful mandate implementation.

Improved data systems will allow Member States and the Secretariat to better fulfill their respective roles in requesting for and implementing mandate delivery.

For instance, enhanced data systems could include the capacity to view the status of mandate implementation and the entity that is responsible for implementation.

Broadly speaking, the establishment of a comprehensive registry would inform users of areas for potential streamlining, which can then be tabled as proposals for consideration by Member States.

While the creation of a robust registry will require time and resources, it will be a powerful tool to reduce duplications.

Second, the creation and implementation of UN activities and reports would benefit from greater coordination.

This is part of a necessary shift in mindset and culture.

We should seek to incentivise a stronger sense of shared ownership and collective responsibility over the mandate life cycle.

Member States should be open to new configurations of mandated products or modalities of mandate delivery.

The aim is to achieve mandated objectives through more efficient and measurable outcomes.

As for reports, Member States should empower the Secretariat to produce more concise and useful reports, with a focus on content and analysis that contribute to impactful mandate delivery.

Thirdly, the Secretariat and UN entities must address fragmentations in mandate delivery and strengthen internal coordination as an ongoing practice.

These two entails a shift in organizational mindset and culture.

A number of factors contribute to the problem of duplication and inefficiency, which include different parts of the system working in silos and competition for resources between agencies.

Stronger internal coordination and division of labor must be embedded as a matter of course in the process of mandate implementation and delivery management within the UN.

We note the Secretariat's proposal in the UN 80 Initiative Action Plan and welcome further efforts by the Secretariat to improve internal coordination and streamlining of mandate delivery.

Co Chairs, small States have always been consistent supporters of the UN and the multilateral system.

At the same time, we are also among the most affected when the system becomes overburdened.

We reiterate our strong commitment to engaging constructively with all Member States and the Secretariat to ensure that the process of mandate implementation is more coordinated, accountable and efficient so as to meet our common objective of effective mandate delivery Co Chairs, Please allow me to make a few additional points in my national capacity.

**Singapore | Representative**

First, I want to thank the briefers for their very insightful opening remarks.

I found them very useful and and I hope that this will give us additional material for reflection.

Second, I agree with our colleague from Liechtenstein that fundamentally, implementation has to be related to the question of how mandates are crafted in the first place.

The greater the clarity and specificity, the better it will be for all of us in terms of measuring and monitoring the implementation of mandates.

In this regard, I think there is a case to be made to look at the length of resolutions.

A longer and more voluminous resolution does not necessarily make the mandate broader or deeper.

It may well end up providing very vague and confusing instructions or guidelines, not just to the Secretariat but also to other Member States.

It is worth thinking, in my view, of a standardized template for resolutions that States can use as a guide as they begin to craft mandates, especially for resolutions that are new.

Ultimately, of course, states would have the sovereign rights and the option to craft their own mandates.

But I think it is time that we make the mindset mindset shift to look at shorter and more succinct resolutions, aided hopefully by the idea of a guiding of some guidelines or templates.

The second point that I wanted to make in my national capacity has to do with the question of periodicity.

This has come up quite regularly.

I think we need to make a distinction between activity and accomplishment.

So the greater frequency of activity does not mean that we are accelerating accomplishment or mandate implementation.

We can adopt a resolution every six months.

That does not mean that we are accelerating the implementation of a mandate or making a difference to improving people's lives in the field.

So that's the first point that I wanted to make with regard to this larger point about periodicity.

Second, we need to make a distinction between an agenda item, a resolution or a draft decision, and reports of the UN Secretary General.

An agenda item can be discussed annually, but a resolution need not be adopted annually.

And a report of the Secretary General, even if there is a request for such a report, need not be done annually.

So let me offer the example of the revitalization we have co chairs here present with us this morning.

We look at there's an agenda item on revitalization that is discussed annually, but the resolution is adopted biannually.

So it's entirely possible that an item is placed on the agenda, and that's the decision of the General Committee that looks at the list of the agenda item.

An item is placed on the agenda possibly annually, but we don't need a resolution to be adopted annually.

It could be done biannually or triannually.

And we don't need a report of the SG on every agenda item on an annual basis.

It could be done biannually, triennially or even beyond.

So I really think the data presented by the Secretariat Under Secretary General Guy Ryder about how we spend 10% of our budget on writing reports is not just financially not sustainable.

It is simply not possible for any of us to read all the reports that we ourselves demand.

So I hope to have further discussions with all Member States on these important issues.

Once again, thank you Co Chairs for your leadership.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Singapore.

I give the floor now to the Philippines on behalf of the middle Income countries.

**Philippines | Representative | (LMG MICs)**

Thank you Co Chairs.

I have the honor to speak on behalf of the Like Minded Group for Middle Income Countries or LMG Mix, composed of Armenia, Belarus, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Lebanon, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, Panama, Peru, the Philippines and Uruguay.

As this is the first time that the Group is addressing this process, we wish to express our support and thank the Co Chairs for the consultations held thus far as well as the panelists for their insights.

Co Chairs Middle income countries represent more than half of the UN membership, are home to more than 70% of the global population and contribute as the third of the global GDP.

Most of the world's poor, nearly 2/3 also reside within our countries.

Further, even countries that achieve graduation from LDCs to middle income status and those middle income countries that aim for high income status continue to face structural barriers on their paths to sustainable development and well being of their people.

It does needs to be emphasized that middle income countries are a group of countries facing specific challenges that need to be addressed and these realities should also inform the UN process including mandate implementation.

Co Chairs allow me to highlight the following first, review of mandates across the UN system should be towards effectiveness and efficiency.

We underscore the importance of the potential range and impact of mandate implementation.

Second, the LMG MIX has so far requested and mandated very few and very reasonable concrete deliverables from the UN system which are intended to create greater impact on the ground.

The Group looks forward to the elaboration of an interagency system wide response plan for middle income countries and reiterates the call for the UN Sustainable Development Group to fill leadership gaps on mixed issues.

Third, the LMG MICS appreciates the continued support by DESA as well as its reporting functions and substantive contributions to the Intergovernmental processes on the agenda of middle income countries.

Fourth, the LMG mix supports advancing a pragmatic approach to delivering results.

Addressing the middle income trap through tailored support for middle income countries requires collaboration.

Hence the Group is pushing for a strategic plan of action for mics.

Lastly, this review process on mandate implementation should be geared towards accelerating efforts to fulfill unfinished business or those that are still in its very early stages of implementation, such as the system wide and increased support for middle income countries for a truly impactful outcome to benefit the vast majority of the world's population and ultimately all of us.

Thank you Co Chairs and please be assured of our continued engagement in the process.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank Philippines I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Barbados on behalf of CARICOM

**Barbados | Representative | (CARICOM)**

Co Chairs.

I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the 14 member states of the Caribbean Community and I align these remarks with a statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of the group of 77 and China at the outset.

We thank you for today's consultations and in particular for the insightful briefing on 30 October.

That session offered a clear understanding of the practical realities within which mandate delivery takes place and has helped shape our contribution here today.

I'd also like to extend our thanks to the Briefers for their valuable and in some cases thought provoking insights.

It's also worth noting, I think, Co Chairs colleagues, that yesterday's discussion in the General assembly on the revitalization of the General assembly highlighted the important convergence between that process and this process.

We must use this convergence to generate synergies.

In discussing mandate implementation.

We are dealing with a stage of the mandate life cycle where Member State decisions must translate into coherent action.

This is where clarity, coordination and adequate resources matter the most.

For small missions, including those small island developing States such as those of caricom, predictability in how mandates are carried out is essential to effective oversight and to our ability to participate meaningfully.

Across the breadth of the UN's work.

CO Chair's implementation occurs within a wide and complex institutional landscape.

The diversity of entities involved reflects the multidimensional character of global challenges, yet it can also result in uneven fragmented responsibilities in delivery and overlapping activities.

CARICOM sees merit in strengthening internal coordination and ensuring that roles are clearly communicated and understood.

When entities work to their respective strengths, mandate delivery becomes more coherent, more efficient and ultimately more impactful.

We further recognize that reporting forms a significant part of implementation.

Reports serve as a key tool for transparency and oversight and they must continue to provide Member States with information that is relevant, clear and analytically useful.

CARICOM supports efforts that focus on enhancing the quality and value of reports while ensuring that any adjustments remain firmly rooted in intergovernmental guidance.

Co Chair's colleagues Funding modalities also shape implementation in profound ways.

The continued reliance on highly earmarked voluntary contributions, combined with the limited flexibility of assessed resources creates challenges for planning and coherence.

CARICOM reiterates a long standing principle mandates must be supported by resources that are predictable and proportionate to the tasks required.

Bridging the gap between expectations and available resources is fundamental to the credibility of the organization and to the confidence of Member States in this regard.

It is critical also for CARICOM that the important and meaningful work being undertaken in the implementation of mandates in the field in our countries and regions and the capacity to do so sustainably does not fall victim to this exercise.

What this stage of the discussion underscores is the importance of an organizational approach that promotes coherence, reduces unnecessary duplication and strengthens accountability.

These are not technical issues alone as they go to the very core of how the United nations delivers on the priorities that Member States have collectively agreed.

Co Chairs CARICOM remains committed to engaging constructively as we move through this process.

Our interest is in a mandate implementation environment that is transparent, coordinative, coordinated and responsive one that respects intergovernment, the intergovernmental nature of the mandates while enabling the system to operate effectively and one that supports the ability of small delegations to follow and contribute to the work of the organization in a meaningful way.

We thank you Co Chairs for your continued leadership and look forward to contributing to the forthcoming discussions on Mandate review, completing our examination of the life cycle in a way that strengthens the ability of the UN to deliver for all and with your permission I would like to offer one brief comment in my national capacity and it connects to the points underlined in particular by former Undersecretary General Amirah Haq.

It is Barbados View that we must pay particular attention in the framing of mandates to their on the ground in the field implementation.

It is here as she so powerfully underlined, that the lives of the people we represent can truly be touched.

I thank you Co Chairs.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank Barbados.

I now give the floor to the Solomon Islands on behalf of the pif.

**Solomon Islands | Representative | (PIF)**

Thank you Co Chairs.

I'm honored to speak on behalf of the Pacific Island Forum members based in New York.

We thank the Co Chairs for the helpful briefing on mandate implementation on 30th October and also for the briefest this morning The Unity Reform Initiative is an important opportunity to make the United nations more effective, efficient and accountable and better able meet today's challenges.

This is especially critical for small island developing states, including those in the Pacific, which depend heavily on the UN for support, expertise and development financing.

As others have said, how well we implement agreed mandates is a key measure of the UN's performance and of us as member states.

Unfortunately, current weaknesses in the mandate implementation, such as poor coordination, too many priorities and lack of restraint, are felt mostly strongly by seeds, including the Pacific Island Forum states.

The UN development system is fragmented and lacks coherence on the ground, which limits its ability to deliver for seats and makes it harder for us to access essential assistance.

Co Chairs the growing number of resolutions, processes, meetings and report is challenging for all, but it can overwhelm smaller delegations who are supported by small policy teams in their capitals.

Fifth, missions are displeased about the recurring overlap between the work of the main committees.

For example, earlier this week, on Wednesday, the General assembly plenary held a secret ballot to fill one vacancy at the International Court of Justice.

At the same time, recorded votes were held both in the second and the fourth Committees.

We are mindful that overlaps can never be entirely prevented.

However, it is extremely difficult for small delegations to be in three places at once.

There are clear steps we can take to ease these burdens.

One, we as Member States should be more disciplined in the meetings we mandate.

Fewer, shorter and more focused meetings in core priorities should be outboard.

Second, we should only request reports when they serve a clear purpose and justify their cost.

Reports should be clear, concise and focused on the key information needed for decision making.

Pasig Island Forum countries are especially concerned about the fragmentation of activities and resources across the event system.

We urge the Secretariat to continue improving coordination and coherence, especially in the field, so that scarce resources go to activities with real impact rather than duplicated programs or administrative overhead.

Co Chairs Coordination mechanisms should strengthen UN impact, not add more bureaucracy.

Member states also have a role in reducing duplication and fragmentation.

We encourage donors, UN entities and development partners to align their support with regional, national and local priorities and to work through existing plans and coordination mechanisms.

Finally, Co Chairs we join others in calling for more stable and flexible financing for the UN system.

Uncertainty around voluntary funding and rigid funding models make planning difficult, waste resources, and force UN leadership to spend more time fundraising than implementing mandates.

The current liquidity crisis is also paralyzing mandate implementation.

We repeat our call for all Member States to pay their assist contributions on time in full and without conditions.

We look forward to working closely with all members throughout this process and I thank you for Chairs, I thank the Solomon Islands.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I now give the floor to Kuwait.

**Kuwait | Representative | (GCC)**

On behalf of the GCC Excellencies, Co Chairs and Distinguished Colleagues, I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the Member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the gcc, the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Sultan of Oman, the State of Qatar, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and my own country, the State of Kuwait.

The GCC aligns itself with the statement delivered by the Republic of Iraq on behalf of the Group of 77 and China Excellencies, let me begin by reiterating our appreciation to Jamaica and New Zealand, the Co Chairs of the Informal Ad Hoc Working Group.

As we approach the point of implementation of the mandate review, the responsibility entrusted in this process becomes ever more critical.

We would also like to express our gratitude to the panelists for their insightful briefings, perspectives and lessons learned.

We echo that the best practices cannot be underplayed to achieve the successful implementation of mandates.

The GCC believes that the Secretary General's initiative continues to be a timely and genuine opportunity to achieve qualitative transformations in the methods of work of the United nations, thus strengthening multilateralism and the overall efficiency in the functions of the un.

We reaffirm that the process of mandate review and the mechanisms for implementing the findings is imperative and must be conducted through careful assessment and with the highest degree of transparency.

Excellencies we welcome the establishment of the UN Mandate Source Registry.

While it is still in its beta version.

We emphasize that the website serves as a marked achievement in ensuring transparency and accessibility that truly feeds into more robust dialogue regarding mandate implementation.

We look forward to advancing the Registry to become a comprehensive source for Member States.

We further encourage the utilization of technology in improving the accessibility of Member States to the Registry as well as providing relevant stakeholders with tools to enable their effective engagement with a large amount of data related to mandates.

Excellencies, we emphasize the benefit of considering integrating an evaluation mechanism into the text of mandates during mandate design as that would enable relevant stakeholders to assess the different elements that would inform the next iteration of the mandate.

We also see the importance of enabling Member States and the Secretariat with the necessary knowledge and capacities to fully engage with the design and creation of said mandates.

Moreover, the process of negotiating and drafting falls to the established procedures, yet we consider it essential to provide the required skills for creating mandates.

To achieve the effective implementation and review of mandates.

True engagement requires a full scope understanding of the material at hand.

While the Designation of roles and functions can be left to establish practices and procedures in relation to the use of technology and specifically AI.

In the process of drafting mandate setting texts, it is crucial that the human element is preserved and takes precedence wherein the human element is the direct engagement of Member States and certified stakeholders.

AI must be utilized as a tool to assist in our prerogatives, while data security and accuracy should remain at the forefront of any and all decisions taken.

In conclusion, the GCC reiterates the core principles of the Charter that the IHWG must be beholden to.

The process itself must always prioritize the inclusion and leadership of member states.

The UN 80 initiative and within all of its precepts is not a downsizing exercise, but an opportunity to increase efficiencies and streamline processes.

Thank you, your Excellencies.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank Kuwait.

I give the floor now to Australia.

**Australia | Representative | (CANZ)**

On behalf of Cairns.

Thank you very much indeed, Chair.

And I thank the briefers who've contributed this morning.

And let me just say thank you so much indeed, Bob, for your final remarks.

I think the notion that we are indeed the masters of a fair degree of our own destiny and that we don't need to be prisoners of established processes really is the critical reflection we should take away from this morning.

I speak of course, on behalf of Canada, New Zealand and Australia.

And as the Secretary General states in the Mandate Implementation Review, mandate delivery is the basis on which Member States and the wider public assess the value of the United nations system.

It's critical to the implementation of the United nations three pillars, and we need absolutely to get this process right.

Many of the recommendations on mandate delivery sit with the Secretariat and we encourage the Secretary General to implement these without delay.

But Member States must also play their part.

We must recognise that the United nations mandates and operating model have become unsustainable due to our own actions.

By mandating thousands of activities in multiple settings, we have left United nations entities spread too thin and promoted duplication and fragmentation of effort across the United nations system.

And we have to recognize that that is in very much part our own responsibility.

We need to ensure that we're using UN resources in a coordinated and effective manner.

Firstly, we need to show restraint in the activities we mandate.

This means being mindful of the costs associated with requesting reports, both commissioning new ones and continuing recurring ones, without clear justification.

And this point has already been made several times this morning.

We encourage the Secretariat to implement recommendations, to shorten reports, combine reports covering similar issues and explore alternative formats, to present information more concisely and to decrease the burden of reporting and improve overall accessibility.

We must also exercise restraint in mandating other activities that have resources.

Implications for the United nations budget and at a minimum, be clear on the implications, both monetary and staffing, of delivering the mandate.

This includes the proliferation of high level meetings and the agreement to limit the number of such meetings due during High Level Week is a useful start, but we all know that we have started that many times before.

We suggest we next consider limiting the number of high level meetings, summits and conferences that are held throughout the year.

The forthcoming moratorium on new international days is another useful step, although every one of us in this room knows full well that there's a current rush to approve new ones before the moratorium comes into place.

Secondly, where mandates with financial implications are agreed, we need to ensure that the United nations has the financial means to implement it.

And to this end, it's essential that Member States pay their assessed contributions in full, on time and without conditions.

Our final point is on coherence and coordination, which is a shared responsibility between Member States and the Secretariat.

Member States need to take a more coherent approach in our engagement across different multilateral settings and be more aware when we are proposing a mandate that already exists creating duplication across the system.

The Secretariat also has a critical role to play in addressing duplication and fragmentation.

We encourage the Secretary General to implement recommendations on enhanced strategic oversight and transparency over the United nations system to achieve a better division of labour and allocation of resources to deliver on mandates.

We also need to strengthen Member State mechanisms for coordinating our work in the General Assembly.

Existing mechanisms such as the General Committee and the Committee on Program Coordination, they are not delivering.

We need an honest conversation about how we can do better.

Mr. Kamani's briefing this morning highlighted the problem of there being no shared implementation picture across the United Nations.

And don't we know that well?

We need better centralised knowledge shared between the Secretariat and all Member States to enable us to to better track mandate implementation.

Achieving more coherent and integrated mandate delivery across the UN system needs to be a key criterion for considering proposals for structural reform and program realignment under Work Stream 3.

We want to see a clearer relationship between effective mandate delivery and any proposed structural reform to enable list.

Fundamentally, we want a modern, functional, forward looking organisation with the capacity to deliver high quality results.

And the above proposals, which cover both Member State and Secretariat responsibilities, in our view form a series of concrete actions that we can all take towards achieving this.

Thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank Australia.

I now give the floor to Romania to be followed by Brazil and then China.

**Romania | Representative**

Thank you very much.

Co chairs and I would like to applaud your engagement and your interaction.

Excessive outreach you have with Member States and different stakeholders.

I think that's very much important.

The European Union spoke on some of the key issues.

I want to address a couple of them.

And building on the comments that our colleague from Liechtenstein, our colleague from Singapore, recently, more recently our colleague from Australia and Barbados have made, you know, the model, the mandate creation is a very important phase.

As a matter of fact, we are looking at implementation.

We know that the assessment on the implementation is not that positive.

The mandate creation is extremely crucial and that's what we are looking at through this revitalization process.

Burhan mentioned and talked about the produccity just now.

James spoke about the moratorium on international days and weeks.

The proof of the efforts is actually easy implementation.

We have agreed just now in early September, an important steps that Member States will have to take, some of them transitioning towards the next session, 81st, when the moratorium would actually enter into force for two years on international days and weeks.

And we will be trying to, you know, we'll limit.

It's a decision to limit the high level meetings during the high level week to three, no more than three.

And actually there is no negotiation on this point.

You have three.

It's a decision, I think it will reflect very badly on Member States not to accept the decision that they haven't taken.

Now the trouble that we have, and I cannot escape the feeling that we are moving forward with different speeds.

I was monitoring somehow looking at the debates in the main committees on the request from this revitalization resolution on how to organize the debates in the main committees, on the working methods in different committees.

And I have that to say that the speed is uneven, the pace is uneven, but also the content and the focus is completely diverse.

And probably we'll have to fix that as well, because that's very much linked to the way we implement our points, our resolutions.

The periodicity of resolution is so much important.

And I very much agree with what Christian has said before.

We request by default reports to the Secretary General expecting and knowing that by requesting a report, that item will stay on the agenda.

And I also agree with Burhan when saying, and that's what we pointed in the revitalization working group, by simply repeating the same resolution every year doesn't strengthen the validity of that resolution of the mandate as well, but also doesn't facilitate the implementation.

And we have to acknowledge that.

And that's a good process.

The Working Group on Mandate Implementation to acknowledge that important notion.

It's something that not very much palpable.

It's not a decision.

We have to internalize this notion, how this process should go forward.

I also want to briefly mention and to applaud the action plan of the Secretary General.

We don't see that separately from the work that we are doing.

It's a very good work.

It somehow encompasses all the work stream that we are looking at with concrete ideas for member states to look at.

And from our point of view, this is also a vehicle that would capture and encourage member states to keep along the same, you know, to get the same.

To get the same pace.

I want to echo Bob's appeal on avoiding this type of ritual exercise, including this meeting as well and many other meetings we have.

We have to look at them anew.

There is quite a lot of stake and it's not only about the financial reforms of this organization.

It's also about the relevance of United nations, how we deliver on all the three pillars.

And that's why these conversations are a matter of important.

And I will end with that.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Thank you very much.

Thank you, Romania.

I give the floor now to Brazil, then China and Chile.

**Brazil | Representative**

Thank you very much.

Dear co chairs, I'm to your very left.

Here I am.

I'm to your very left.

Thank you very much for your fantastic work.

Thank you very much for the this meeting.

Thank you very much for the briefers from whom I learned very much.

I will not read my statement.

My expert will forgive me.

I will send them to you.

But since I have only three minutes, I'd like to accept the invitation that the distinguished Pierromene just made us to be, to change our own ways of doing things, including this meeting, and be as interactive as possible.

First of all, and this will be a bit disorganized, but trying to refer to the issue at hand, Brazil will be.

Will continue to be very open to considering all good ideas to achieve our collective goals in terms of gaining efficiencies, et cetera.

And I tend to agree with most of what has been said here in terms of specific areas to look into to achieve our objective.

But at the same time, I think we should be very clear that there are risks along the way.

The first risk is for us and Guy Rader mentioned issue of funding and thank you very much, other colleagues.

I think Bob mentioned that this is about money.

This is about money.

And it's, I think, reasonable to believe that if we were not in a liquidity crisis, we'd not be doing what we are doing.

But I have said it before and I truly believe that, that it's quite unfortunate that we are going through this process in the middle of a liquidity crisis because obviously the.

Even if you have a trillion dollars wasting our taxpayers money is not a good thing to do.

So the search for efficiency, for the optimal use of resources, taxpayer money is critical.

At the same time, the risk we run doing this in the middle of a liquidity crisis is I think more than twofold.

But one is not forgetting why we are in the liquidity crisis.

Member states must pay their dues, period.

We have to remember that.

Secondly, we run the risk of throwing the baby out of the.

With the baby water baby, the bath water and this.

And part of the problem is that there are many babies in this bathtub and there will be some that will not like some babies that will be some that will like some babies.

So the first thing to do is if we are unfortunately throwing out some babies which we don't like, we all hate, that's unhuman or unhumane.

But we will have to come to a fair balanced agreement of what we do and what we do not do.

For example, limiting the number of high level meetings.

It is very likely that some who do not prefer a given issue will not like this issue to be among the 3, 4, 5 high level meetings.

Some who love some issues will want probably annual resolutions of that particular issue.

And those who do not like that issue will not want annual resolutions.

I'm just saying that we have to be fair and we have to be true to ourselves and not naive.

And secondly, and finally, yes, I think we have all.

We all agree that our methods have become sometimes rigid, ritualistic, etc. But they are there for a reason.

They are there for a reason, processes, et cetera.

We have to take a fresh look at them all.

But again, not believing that one will make a revolution here will not.

We know that.

And in looking at these methods to search for fairness and balance as we do that.

Thank you very much.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank Brazil.

I give the floor now to China to be followed by Chile and then Switzerland

**China | Representative**

coutures China aligns itself with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of G77 and China.

In light of the Secretary General's report and other briefings, I wish to share the following points.

First, internal coordination within the Secretariat should be strengthened.

The Action Plan for advancing the UN 80 initiative submitted by the Secretary General will help ensure that the UN 80 initiative is implemented in a more substantive and effective manner which China fully supports the action plan, proposes measures to enhance senior management coordination.

China looks forward to detailed recommendations in this regard.

The UN system comprises more than 140 entities, each of which has its own areas of expertise.

We hope that all entities will focus on their core mandates, leverage their competitive strength, minimize duplication of efforts and make the best possible use of the limited resources.

Second, meetings and reports should be concrete and concise.

There is a broad consensus on the need for the improvement of meetings and reports.

China suggests we focus on the following three aspects.

First is to adopt a swift, proactive, programmatic and effective working style focusing on improving people's lives.

Meetings should start on time and statements and reports should go straight to the points and avoid lengthy and repetitive discussions.

Second is to enhance the quality of meetings and reports.

The Secretariat has already proposed ideas such as adapting reports formats, enhanced data representation and focus on key issues.

We look forward to to detail the plans to translate these ideas into actions and practical proposals for improving meeting and report quality.

At the same time, China stress that the importance and value of the UN's report it has provided tremendous insights to the governments, academias, NGOs across the board.

Third is to streamline the number of meetings and reports.

The Secretariat has established a work package on Secretary General's reports.

We hope this mechanism will view review reports with similar content and release time and make specific recommendations for their streamlining.

The Secretariat could also provide specific recommendations to Member States on combining meetings, shortening the length of meeting sessions and reducing reviews frequency with a view to achieving tangible results.

Third, on funding.

Voluntary contributions are an important supplement to the UN's work, but the assessed contributions are the foundation.

As the second largest contributor to the UN regular budget, China has always actively fulfilled its financial obligations.

We have already fully paid our assessed contributions this year, a total of US$680 million, and we will continue to firmly support the UN and multilateralism through concrete actions.

At the same time, we urge the largest contributor to fulfill its own financial obligations.

I thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank China for its statement.

I give the floor now to Chile and then Switzerland and then the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

**Chile | Representative**

Thank you, Co Chairs.

Chile aligns itself with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of the group of 77 and China and with Philippines on behalf of MICS.

I also would like to express my appreciation to both of you, the Co Chairs for the organization of the latest briefing and to the panelists for sharing their experiences.

An effective and coherent implementation of mandates across the United nations system is fundamental to ensuring that the organizations remain strong agile and credible.

For this reason, the implementation stage of the mandate life cycle must be further reinforced and continuously improved.

Chile recognized the various challenges that persist during the mandate delivery phase of the life cycle, notably the risks of duplication, misaligned funding modalities, and the excessive volume and duration of meetings and reports, which often outweigh their actual impact.

As a former President of ecosoc, I would like to share an example from our work on the 2024 HLPF Ministerial Declaration, which one negotiated must be submitted in parallel to both the General assembly and ECOSOC for adoption in 2024.

The submission of an amendment to a vote in the HLPF and the subsequent adoption of the amendment declaration created a lack of clarity on the way forward, as previous practice suggested that the ECOSOC should consider two original text.

After initially doing so and following extensive consultations, I ultimately decided to submit to ECOSOC the amended version of the Declaration in order to avoid ending up with two different versions of the same Ministerial Declaration.

This example illustrates how procedural arrangement can lead to duplications requiring additional time and resources to resolve matters that should ideally follow a streamlined process.

The coordination segment of the ECOSOC itself is a good platform to strengthen the coordination capacity within the Sustainable Development Pillar.

The new ECOSOC revision should be coordinated with this work of this Working Group as well.

Another challenge lights in the current financial situation of the organization, which continues to erode the capacity of UN entities to fully implement the mandate entrusted to them.

These entities face an increasingly difficult environment in this sense, as spending reduction targets further constrain their ability to execute their approved budgets.

Decisive and collective action is therefore needed to reverse this trend.

Let's turn the funding challenge into an opportunity because, as Brazil mentioned, because even if we had all the money available, we will still need to do this work the way we have been doing its it is losing meaning for the people we are meant to serve.

In conclusion, I would like to reiterate our support for the Co Chairs and reaffirm Chile's commitment to engaging constructively in the work of this Working Group.

Thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank Chile.

I give the floor to Switzerland and then the Netherlands.

**Switzerland | Representative**

Co Chairs, colleagues, Switzerland thanks you for your continued leadership.

During our tenure as an elected member of the UN Security Council, Switzerland led efforts to establish a resolution on the protection of humanitarian personnel.

During the course of the consultation, we reached out to the Secretariat sharing wording suggestions and we were advised that in this particular instance it was preferred preferable to opt for a requirement of regular oral briefings of senior UN officials rather than a regular written report.

We took this on board and this helped us to devise the mandate accordingly and go into the direction of effective mandate delivery.

This example illustrates what previous briefings have shown in more detail, which is that well crafted mandates are key enablers for effective implementation.

Co Chairs allow me to make three points.

First, we would like to have clearer understanding of what the Secretary General can already do under his or her own authority, especially to improve delivery management.

For example, in a quote, making better use of system wide coordination platforms to avoid duplication, end of quote, such as the Interagency Standing Committee or the CEBU are measures that we believe the SG can already act upon today.

Second, regarding meetings and reports, Switzerland supports efforts to reduce their number.

Reports should be clearer, shorter, more focused and wherever feasible, reports could be combined.

We also encourage the use of different formats such as short update reports instead of lengthy annual documents.

In our own system, Swiss diplomats across the world have been instructed to privilege shorter reporting and analysis formats for their daily work, as opposed to more detailed reports at specific situations and for lesser frequency.

There is no doubt that we can learn and get inspiration from how the 192 other diplomatic representations and services represented here deal with these very same challenges of information overload, acceleration, limited staffing and so on.

Switzerland is also open to exploring technical solutions.

Could artificial intelligence tool under human supervision be used to cross check reports for redundancies or provide cross references to related reports?

Given the successful experience of setting up the mandate Registry, how about improving the technical interface for reporting by creating an online space that allows for user friendly access to all participants products of existing mandates, taking into consideration multilingualism and accessibility for all.

Switzerland, including with our academic partners, stands ready to share its experience in this regard and we take good note of suggestions made earlier, including by Ambassador Kimani and others.

Third, and finally, real impact in mandate delivery depends on coordination and tapping into synergies.

Efficient mandate delivery requires entities to share knowledge and work hand in hand across UN hubs.

Take human rights.

The Human Rights Council in Geneva and the General assembly here in New York must operate in lockstep.

We gain valuable insights from the Council mandates implementation that are of relevance for our work here.

So let's break down silos not only thematically but also geographically.

I thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Thanks Switzerland.

I give the floor now to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, to be followed by Iran and Mexico.

**Netherlands | Representative**

Thank you and dear co Chairs, I'd like to thank you for your leadership in conducting this intergovernmental process.

We welcome the proposed solutions in The Secretary General's report on mandate implementation review.

And I'm particularly happy to see USG Ryder here present in this debate the Kingdom of the Netherlands alliance itself with the Statement of the European Union.

And I would like to add a few elements in my national capacity.

And I would like to focus on three points with regard to recommendations put forward in the SG report.

First, regarding prioritization and streamlining meetings and reporting obligations.

This requires a clear sense of direction, taking into account what a UN should look like in the future, taking into account the needs of future generations.

In particular, we urge the Secretary General to act as swiftly as possible.

We consider these recommendations as low hanging fruit and necessary to execute.

Given the financial situation the organization is facing.

We would encourage the formulation of criteria on the basis of which meetings and reports could be prioritized and streamlined.

These criteria in our view could include, for example, relevance and strategic alignment, impact and utilization, duplication and overlap, synergies and integration, potential cost and resource efficiency, legal and political feasibility and digital and procedural efficiency.

Secondly, the SG's report contains interesting statistics on mandate delivery, management and coordination.

And according to the report and the so called heat map, the risk of duplication in the development cluster is about 51%.

And I think we all want to make sure that we increase the impact of our development assistance.

And I think that this is a joint commitment that we share.

So it should not be a taboo to look at the way to talk about how we do that, how we make sure that we increase the impact by lowering the duplication.

And it would be helpful if the Secretary General could provide greater insight into the specific areas where duplication is actually occurring and where positive overlap is also taking place.

Third and last, we would be in favor of asking the Secretary General for recommendations on how to further optimize the functioning of existing bodies in coordinating performing the oversight role in the UN mandate delivery.

So, for example, we believe optimization could be found in better functioning and cooperation between the Committee of Programming and Coordination, the UN Sustainable Development Group, the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination, the Joint Inspection Unit, the coordination role of the ecosoc and most importantly with a strong two regional bodies and empowered Resident Coordinator system and reconfigured UN country teams.

I thank you for your attention.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of the Netherlands and I now give the floor to the distinguished distinguished representative of Iran, to be followed by Mexico.

**Iran, Islamic Republic of | Representative**

Thank you, Madam Chair.

At the outset we thank you for convening this meeting which provides an opportunity to exchange views on enhancing the delivery and coherence of United Nations Mandates the Islamic Republic of Iran aligns itself with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of Group 77 and China.

We recognize that the proposals on the demanded delivery aims at enhancing efficiency and effectiveness through streamlining the meetings and reporting process, make funding mechanism more impactful and less fragmentation and enhanced coherence and coordination.

We attach great importance to ensuring that the implementation of mandates is fully aligned with nationally defined development priorities.

Such alignment is essential to achieve tangible and sustainable results that respond to the realities and aspirations of Member States and offer greater likelihood of success in this regard.

We believe that the successful implementation of mandates must be accompanied by systematic investment in institutional and human capacity in developing countries.

Any reduction in resources could constrain training programs, capacity building initiatives and the transfer of technology, thereby weakening our collective ability to address global challenges effectively.

The role of regional and sub regional structures is also indispensable for ensuring responsiveness and inclusiveness in mandate delivery.

The preservation and adequate resourcing of regional commissions and field offices are vital to enable them to respond effectively to regional priorities and specific local contexts.

Downsizing or reducing staff in these offices would risk eroding institutional memory and limiting the ability of developing countries to access timely and equitable support from the UN system.

Further, we stressed that the Secretariat should maintain a neutral and balanced role in implementing mandates and supporting Member States in achieving their objectives.

We also underscore that the UN entities must operate within the parameters set by Member States, adhering strictly to intergovernmentally agreed language and avoiding any perception of Secretariat driven initiatives.

We believe this approach is essential for preserving the credibility and technical integrity of Secretariat's work.

Finally, we encourage enhanced transparency and regular update on the status of mandate implementation, including clear explanations for any non or partial implementation.

We believe that mandates should be treated fairly and for the benefit of the entire membership.

Comprehensive information sharing will enable Member States to identify gaps, improve coordination and ensure that the organization's work remains guided by the collective priorities of all members in an efficient and effective manner.

Thank you, Madam Chair.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Iran.

And I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Mexico, to be followed by Argentina.

**Mexico | Representative**

Thank you for giving me the floor, Madam Chair.

Mexico expresses its gratitude to the Co Chairs for their dedicated leadership and reference its support for the proposals.

But forward in the Secretary's General Report, Co Chairs allow me to outline four proposals Mexico believes are relevant for our collective exchange on the implementation phase of the mandate life cycle.

First, breaking counterproductive practices.

Our long standing practice of layering new directions upon existing ones without allowing Time to fully implement or assess them has generated an accumulation of tasks, overlapping duplications and bottlenecks.

A prudent cooling off period would enable mandates to be properly implemented before new decisions are introduced on the symptomatic area.

This will help restore coherence and prevent the continuous pileup of paragraphs, requests and reporting lines that ultimately hinder the purpose they seek to advance.

Second, a forward looking approach Implementation should not be conceived in isolation from evaluation.

A preventive system wide mindset, one that anticipates how a mandate will be assessed, must guide the design and implementation of activities.

Ensuring alignment between objectives, indicators and institutional capacities is the only way to secure relevance, pertinence and meaningful impact.

3. Strengthening coherence Improving implementation requires system wide solutions.

We propose developing a centralized and transparent architecture for mandate implementation.

A dedicated implementation section in the UN Mandate Source Registry should be established to enhance accounting interpretability, prevent unintentional duplication and enable evidence based decision making.

It would allow identifying the responsible entity, expected deliverables, timelines, resource requirements and potential overlap with existing tasks.

At the organizational level, the Committee on Program and Coordination CPC is the bridge between mandates and programs.

It is the institutional body specifically designed to ensure coherence and coordination during implementation.

Strengthening and modernizing the CPC must be central component of the UN reform.

This requires elevating the level and quality of its deliberations and outcomes and enhancing its visibility according to its responsibility.

Fourth, and lastly, clarity and continuity.

Persistent inconsistencies in the interpretation of mandates, combined with dispersed institutional memory and internal coordination across the system, have undermined coherent implementation among agencies.

The Secretariat should be equipped and authorized to provide formal system wide interpretative guidance on mandates, especially when discrepancies or ambiguities arise.

A strengthened duty to warm Mechanism will be enabled to Secretariat to alert Member States when a mandate contradicts an existing instruction, exceeds available capacities or risk duplication.

I thank you, Madam Chair.

I thank the distinguished representative of Mexico and I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Argentina to be followed by ourselves.

**Argentina | Representative**

Salvador, thank you.

Thank you very much.

Good morning all Protocol observes.

So allow me to share some inputs from our point of view and we will try to follow some of the items in the Secretary General's report on this.

So when it comes to proliferation of meetings and reports, we believe that this is an area we could have impactful changes immediately regarding the report proliferation.

We agree that there is a report proliferation in terms of quantity and length.

This proliferation undermines also the quality of reports and we are supportive of the idea of Shorter reports that maintain a high quality, a level of high quality.

Many annual reports could be issued every two or three years.

Indeed, but there is no one size fits all on this we should assess the merit.

But also the different dynamics on the different UN bodies.

It's not the same dynamic in the Security Council, the ecosocial, the General assembly, even its committee have different dynamics.

And if we go to the whole UN system, I mean different governing bodies have different dynamics.

So it's a challenging process.

Maybe to reduce the quantity of reports, the idea of joint reports could be explored among the several structures of the UN system.

Regional perspective could be also integrated in a single report.

And this idea of joint reports should not undermine the different views that the system might have on the same issue.

Also, reports by thematic clusters could be explored based on the work organization of each committee of the General assembly or in the dynamics of each body regarding meetings proliferation, we see this as a problem that within the UN system that we could resolve shortly if we have political will.

It's a collective responsibility, as we said, among Member states, but also among the Secretariat.

In our view, part of this problem of the proliferation of meeting is closely related to the over dimension and proliferation of certain political agendas within the UN system.

As we said before, we need a realistic diagnostic on this issue.

And it's not only a problem with the quality, with the quantity, but also with the quality of meetings, because in the long term dilutes the quality of interaction between Member states.

And we see also as part of this problem the proliferation of parallel meeting and processes or Secretary initiatives that do not have intergovernmental mandates that are also part of this proliferation meeting.

When it comes to, I would say delivery, management and coordination.

I mean, the issue of fragmentation, overlap, duplication, as has been said, is more a comprehensive discussion.

But the way maybe of citing mandates along the UN entities when it comes to program at budget is something that needs to be improved and revisit maybe also the discussion on the role of the cpc.

But we have seen in the reports that more than 20 entities are putting budget implications with the same mandate.

So when we create a mandate, we should maybe evaluate a specific assignment for an entity to be the primary responsible for implementation, or maybe give to the Secretary General the prerogative to indicate which entity should coordinate that.

And maybe when we set, when we give broad mandates or open mandates, I've seen many resolutions we request the UN system to do this.

Maybe that should be avoided because not only generates duplication and fragmentation, but also competition for resources and to finalize link this with the idea of funding.

I mean the discussion around funding.

We see this also a part of a link between some over dimension agendas, fragmentation of the UN system and funding modalities that at some point are in our view undermining the core mandate that the United nations should have.

I thank you,

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of Argentina.

And I now give the floor to the distinguished permanent representative of El Salvador, to be followed by Paraguay.

**El Salvador | PR**

Thank you very much.

Madam Co Chair.

My delegation align itself with the statements that were delivered previously by Iraq and the Philippines and in national capacity.

We would like to mention the following Co Chairs.

Mandate implementation, as we have been expressing before, is not an abstract notion.

It is actually the day to day, day to day work that translate the intergovernmental decisions into concrete impact.

So therefore, the efforts to strengthen efficiency, we believe that must not be equated with reducing programmatic ambition.

Rather, they should focus on refining the mechanisms, processes and also the resources necessary to ensure full and timely implementation.

So efficiency must enhance delivery, not dilute the mandates.

And in that sense, our delegation is really open to discuss some measures that have been previously expressed, like the length of the reports that we definitely agreed and also the discussion, periodic discussions.

In the same manner.

Addressing fragmentation during implementation cannot be limited to a funding discussion.

For us, it requires a serious examination of coordination across the UN system.

So fragmentation is often felt mostly in the field, where the overlaps and duplications can hinder coherence.

It can also complicate partnerships and reduce the quality of support provided to the governments.

And in that sense, an honest field based assessment of these dynamics is essential to improving the mandate delivery.

We are concerned by the competition for resource among entities.

This is nothing new.

Other delegations have also mentioned and this should never compromise the quality, consistency and also the credibility of the UN presence on the ground.

And Member States have the responsibility to ensure that the system function precisely as a system, not as a collection of competing institutions.

We emphasize that increased flexibility in redeploying resources can only be contemplated if delegations have a clear common understanding of its scope and also the limit limitations.

So flexibility Co Chairs cannot become a substitute for proper oversight.

It must operate strictly within the frameworks that safeguard full accountability.

So any discussions on optimizing restricting the existing structures must take into account the distinct mandates, working methods, timelines of entities, and also the headquarters in Vienna, Geneva and and idobi.

Because these differences matter.

Yes, they shape operational realities and therefore require a tailored and thoughtful consideration.

So close consultations with their secretariats is crucial.

If we are to achieve coherence and also a comprehensive outcome.

Co Chairs allow me to conclude with a simple through our biggest challenge do not come from lack of rules, but from lack of implementation and also a sustained engagement by Member States.

And the reason why I'm saying this is if the agreements of the GA revitalization process were applied were rigor, we will not be debating mandate accumulation or work cycle pressure today.

So these lessons must inform precisely the UN 80 initiative because when Member States engage seriously and follow through, the revitalization delivers true results.

So El Salvador definitely will continue supporting you Co Chairs and we support any approach that definitely delivers and change over current situation.

Thank you very much.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I think the distinguished Permanent Representative of El Salvador and I now give the floor to the distinguished Permanent Representative of Paraguay to be followed by the Russian Federation Couture.

**Paraguay | PR**

Good morning to everyone.

My delegation wishes to express its recognition, appreciation and full support for the work carried out by you both, Brian and Carolyn, as a co facilitator, we truly value your constructive efforts in this process.

Turning to step two on Monday Delivery, we consider this discussion essential to strengthening the United nations capacity to deliver effectively and currently on hinge mandates, we took note of the three main challenges that continue to hinder mandate delivery and reduce our collective impact according to the Secretary General report.

First, we are really worried as a small mission, as many other delegations in this room, about the growing number of meeting and length reports.

We are really worried this situation has created an administrative burden that often outweigh the benefits.

Many reports are not only long but also repetitive and rarely consult to tackle.

This preparation is key and in that sense we suggest establishing a system that identifies which meeting reports at a greatest strategic value, suspend or merge those that are redundant and optimize report format with clear length limits.

Once again, we support the secure and responsible use of artificial intelligence to help summarize, translate and link related reports, making information more accessible and cost efficient.

Second, regarding the management of mandate delivery, stating that there is still a lack of clarity in how responsibilities are divided which lead to duplication and efficiency.

According to point number 41 of the report, existing oversight in the United nations system focuses mainly on program planning, budgets and operational issues of individual United nations entities in isolation, rather than seeking to ensure strategic alignment across the system to drive impact and efficiency.

To overcome this, we support the idea of having a centralized oversight mechanism within the Secretariat to monitor coherence across man mandates and we see value in establishing permanent interagency coordination platform to ensure better collaboration across entities.

Third, with regard the misaligned funding modalities.

We encourage the proposed solution to fully apply all commitments by Member States and the United nations system through the founding compact and strengthened dialogue.

To this end couture, we need to be pragmatic and we believe this practical step could make mandate delivery more current, efficient and aligned with our shared vision of a stronger multilateral system, one that delivers real results for people and communities on the ground.

And finally, we wish to underline the need for greater and better better coordination with the Secretariat so that its perspective and concerns are heard and seriously considered.

Especially since the implementation of mandate relies heavily on their daily work.

Thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished Permanent Representative of Paraguay.

And I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation, to be followed by the United States.

United States.

**Russian Federation | Representative**

Thank you, Madam Chair.

I would like to say that we support the practical steps to improve coordination and efficiency in the delivery of mandates.

Existing interagency platforms can be used more effectively to reduce duplication while respecting the independent and mandates of each entity and division of labor.

I think a lot of delegations speak to this end today.

At the same time, Russia cannot agree with proposals that would expand the Secretariat's autonomy in prioritizing or streamlining mandated activities.

Decisions of priority must remain with the Member States.

Financial operational considerations cannot justify the modification, delay or non implementation of mandates adopted by intergovernmental organs.

I would echo what Mr. Ray said about the money and this position.

To all questions, the answer is money is as old as our Bible, the book of Ecclesiastes.

But still we think that we should not allow, as they say, the tail wag the dog.

And the Member States have to finally determine what they want and then decide how to provide for it.

We are concerned by suggestions to to shorten, merge or reprioritize mandated reports.

We totally agree we should have shorter resolutions, but we don't agree we should have shorter reports.

Reporting is essential accountability and transparency tool and must remain comprehensive, accurate and accessible.

Moreover, the UN 80 is an initiative which is a good opportunity to instruct the UN Secretary General to improve the quality of the Secretary General reports by addressing the issue of methodology of report preparation.

In particular, we are very concerned about the sources of information which become, so to say, legitimized by the Secretary General reports.

And of course, these improvements must go hand in hand with enhanced methodology for the Secretariat's self evaluation of mandate delivery, which needs to be reflected.

And special attention should be given to the sources of information as well as separate review of mandates that are delivered at the cost of voluntary contributions, especially with the information that we have reconfirmed today by Guy Ryder by the amount of voluntary contributions.

Proposals to align or redeploy resources internally without the approval of the General assembly would undermine the budgetary prerogatives of the member states.

Russia also stresses that we cannot support the reference in the Secretary General reports to the Resident Coordinator system as a successful tool of strengthening internal oversight of the UN division of labor.

I think that there are a lot of challenges to this so called successes.

Thank you very much.

**United States | Representative**

Thank you Co chairs and colleagues.

I'm inspired by the remarks of our distinguished colleague who's retiring, the permanent representative from Canada.

I think his remarks were spot on and in the spirit of honoring that and being very inspired by what he said, I'm going to throw out most of what I wrote here because it's duplicative of what many of you, almost all of you have said here this morning.

Not everyone.

Some people like long reports.

Some people like overlapping mandates, Some people like spending money on paper in meetings instead of impact on the ground.

But I would say that if we took a poll amongst this room, reforming how we write and implement mandates would have more popularity than ice cream.

And ice cream is pretty popular.

So I'm going to throw out my remarks and make one general point and two specific points.

I submit.

We submit that efficient and effective delivery and measurable impact should be at the heart of everything we do in our work here at the United Nations.

And it's worth noting that in 2024 alone we spent, the United nations spent $360 million on the direct costs, meetings and reports.

Let me repeat that in case it wasn't clear.

$360 million not on maintaining and promoting international peace and security or providing life saving aid, but on meetings and reports.

And These reports are 40% longer than they were 20 years ago.

Now if anyone can show me that we are 40% more useful, insightful and actionable because of these reports, are we achieving better, faster or smarter decisions because of these 40% increase in the reports?

I'll buy dinner.

But I don't think you're going to be able to prove that.

So this is great and I really appreciate the hard work and focus of the co chairs.

We are fully, we the United States, stand ready to work with every member state and with the co Chairs who are focused on this most important and critical work But I would ask you, as you leave here today and get ready for a nice weekend, if we're all agreeing, or almost all of us are agreeing that this needs to happen, then let's make it happen.

We don't need four hour meetings and lots of talking in the halls.

Let's get this going and we stand ready to support and help Co Chairs in anything you need to put this into action.

Thank you so much for your hard work.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished representative of the United States and I now give the floor to the distinguished Representative of Croatia to be followed by Japan.

**Croatia | Representative**

Implementation and we would also like to commend your leadership in steering this important process.

Croatia aligns itself with the statement delivered by the European Union on behalf of its Member States and I would like to add a few remarks in my national capacity.

We welcome the continued focus on mandate implementation as noted in the previous meeting and reflected in the Secretary General's report on Stream 2.

Three key concerns the proliferation of meetings and reports, the inadequate management of mandate delivery and misaligned funding modalities.

We share these concerns.

However, we wish to emphasize that many of these issues stem from the way mandates are created.

As we stressed previously, mandates must be concise, clear and purpose driven to ensure effective implementation.

Mandates should also be flexible enough to allow the Secretary General and the UN management to allocate responsibility to in the most efficient manner without micromanagement from Member States.

In this period, we underline four key points.

First, clarity of scope and objectives.

Mandates should establish measurable goals aligned with strategic priorities to reduce overlap and sharpen focus.

2. Integrated delivery frameworks we support the SGE's proposal for common administrative platforms and consolidated functions to unify efforts and reduce fragmentation across UN entities.

3. Enhanced field level Coordination Coordination must improve not only at the country level but also regionally to ensure mandates are context sensitive and impactful.

Data driven monitoring and robust metrics and real time reporting will support adaptive implementation.

4. Flexible funding with accountability Member States should uphold the Funding Compact and enable the Secretariat to redeploy resources swiftly, especially to safeguard essential country level delivery.

This flexibility must be paired with accountability and transparent justification.

In conclusion, effective mandate implementation begins with thoughtful mandate design.

By ensuring mandates are strategic, streamlined and supported by flexible systems, we can empower the UN to deliver with greater coherence and impact.

Thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished Representative of Croatia.

I give the floor now to Japan to be followed by Vietnam and Timor Lest.

**Japan | Representative**

Thank you Co Chair and thank you Brief for their insightful and informative briefings.

Japan would like to make three comments regarding this mandate Delivery Phase first, we encourage the Secretary General to make full use of his authority as the Chief Administrative Officer to move forward on areas where action can be taken without delay in order to avoid duplication and ensuring strategic and coherent use of resources across the UN system.

Some of those concrete measures in this regard were mentioned in the SG report, so I don't repeat here.

Second, as for the actions requiring the approval by Member States, Japan welcomed concrete proposals such as streamlining meeting schedules and reducing the volume of reports, and we have already been and will continue to be flexible in accommodating the Secretariat's concrete proposal in this regard.

Finally, regarding the proposal on the flexible funding, we recognize the need for greater flexibility to respond to emergencies and unforeseen circumstances.

At the same time, we wish to emphasize that it is necessary to examine whether the flexible funding proposal by the Secretariat will lead to improved efficiency in mandatory implementation.

Furthermore, for voluntary contributions, alike assessed contributions, a high level of accountability to the Member States is required.

In other words, it is important to ensure that funding mechanism preserves the incentive for donor countries to make contributions.

Therefore, we believe that such discussions should take place in existing forums involving the relevant Member States and UN entities, and we stand ready to continue participating them.

I thank you, I thank the distinguished representative of Japan.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I give the floor now to Vietnam to be followed by Timor Lest and then Saudi Arabia.

**Viet Nam | Representative**

Thank you very much.

Co Chairs, I I thank you for all your efforts and I thank also the briefers for the very nice presentations.

Allow me to just make two points and both of them in fact are a bit related to money.

Number one is there's a narrative that the UN80 process is caused by or driven by the lack of money.

I beg to differ a bit because I believe that the need to change, the need for reform, is a constant desire that we have had for many, many years.

An example is the Delivering as One initiative which has been piloted since 2007 in a set of seven countries.

And there are a lot that have been done and a lot that have changed and driven change.

So the current crisis may give us a stronger push, a sense of urgency.

But I believe that this must remain a long term endeavor for all of us.

After, after UN80, there will have to be UN90, UN100 and beyond.

So that's the first point I wanted to make.

Second, I wanted to emphasize and focus on funding.

We get what we fund.

The current situation is that funding is more short term than strategic, it creates more competition than coherence, and it is often in most Cases more driven by individual donor priorities rather than collective commitments.

Now my experience at the country level has been that, you know, when I ask for funding for certain activities, when it comes to gender equality, women, peace and security, there's plenty of that.

But if I ask for funding for a child rights event or an agricultural event, it's very hard to find the funding.

So it's not meeting the needs of the country where the UN is operating.

And it is because of the funding fragmentation.

And I really liked how the SG puts it in the report which says fragmentation and funding leads to fragmentation in implementation.

And I think it's critical that we change this pattern of funding.

We have to encourage more multi year unearmarked funding and it may be useful to revisit the role and the effectiveness of pooled funding mechanisms that we had in the past, including the MDG Fund, the Multi Partner Trust Fund, and also revisit the lessons learned from the various reform initiatives that we have had.

And finally, because we are talking about short term meetings, I encourage you to have a MIC cutoff enforcement in your upcoming meetings.

Thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Thank you.

I give the floor now to Timur Leste followed by Saudi Arabia.

**Timor-Leste | Ambassador**

Thank you Co Chair.

Just to be very brief, we commend your hard work and we share most of the opinions that actually being shared across this room.

Just want to make a few points from a programmatic standpoint and take into account the financial shortcomings.

I think we need to actually concentrate on certain programmatic issues when it comes to this reform apart from what has been said in the report of the the Secret General at first I think we need to look into the mandate cycle design, life cycle design.

Second, I think we need to actually also look into the coherence in terms of programmatic architecture, the issue of like merging and no repetition and so on.

And then the third point is on the operational alignment, particularly in the use of data driven systems, shared platforms and interoperable tools to elevate programmatic delivery rather than merely administrative efficiency.

And then we also actually have to I think take into account the adaptive programming, particularly in terms of mandates and programs that have to be responsive and evolving with the evolving realities.

And also looking into issues of capacity building, localization, particularly in the last developed countries.

In summary co chairs, just to comply with what my colleague from Vietnam has said, I mean the UN 80 program agenda is about doing things differently, differently.

So not simply doing the same things with less, but structuring programs so that they are coherent, outcome oriented, integrated, adaptable and designed for hanover it's about shifting from an organization where mandates accumulate to one where programs deliver and transition.

Thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished Ambassador of Timor Leste and I'll give the floor to the distinguished PR of Saudi Arabia to be followed by Ecuador and then the UK

**Saudi Arabia | Representative**

Excellency is distinguished delegates.

My delegation alliance itself itself with the statements made by Iraq on behalf of the G77 and China and by Kuwait on behalf of the GCC Co chairs, we wish to express our sincere appreciation for your wise leadership in guiding the work of the informal ad hoc working group and for convening this meeting to consider the second phase of the mandate review cycle.

We also appreciate the efforts made in preparing in preparing the Secretary General's report on this matter, which provided a clear overview of the challenges in this era.

Along with a set of recommendations Co chairs, the report identifies major challenges hindering effective mandate implementation, including overlapping, excessive meetings and reports, procedural complexity and weak institutional coordination.

In return, the report proposed set of solutions such as simplifying procedures, reducing duplication in meetings and reports and strengthening coordination among UN entities.

In this context, we view the proposed recommendations positively and we would like to put forward a couple of practical measures to strengthening implementation of mandates.

These measures include forming coordination team among UN agencies with similar mandates to develop joint implementation plans as well as streamlining meetings with similar topics.

Additionally, employing artificial intelligence to analyze reports and monitor commitments can help build an integrated database on the mandate's implementation.

Co Chairs.

In conclusion, we wish to reiterate that the success of this second phase of the mandate review cycle depends on on a realistic and comprehensive approach that enhances the effectiveness of the UN system and delivers tangible results.

My delegation reaffirmed its commitment to support efforts to develop practical mechanisms that strengthen mandate implementation and the objectives of the UN Charter.

I thank you.

Thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished Permanent Representative of Saudi Arabia.

I give the floor to the distinguished PR of Ecuador.

**Ecuador | PR**

I thank you.

And I thank the Cocheres for their leadership and their briefers for their insightful feedback.

I also value the Secretary General's proposals, especially those focused on streamlining reports and meetings, leveraging digital tools and enhancing internal coordination.

Every resource saved should be redirected to concrete action.

Colleagues, within the allocated three minutes, allow me once again to briefly speak about my experience as President of the Executive Board of undp, UNFPA and unops.

By the way, with some reluctance, but with final understanding of the rationale behind it, we managed to cut off the MIC after three minutes.

So feel free to do it with me if I exceed that time.

There, in our Board, we have prioritized efficiency by reducing official sessions, improving coherence in decision making and generating savings that benefit the organization.

We have also worked to ensure that the decisions adopted by our Board are as coherent and implementable as possible and based on the Agency's mandates.

Of note, this year, in my capacity as President of the Triple Board, I visited Panama, Jordan and Egypt where I observed the tangible impact of UN initiative initiatives from watershed management and refugee health services to climate adaptation and food security.

These experiences convince me that our success is measured not by reports, but by real improvements in people's lives in some of the most challenging contexts.

Understanding operations on the ground helps identify synergies and prevent duplication, fostering complementarity rather than competition as we move forward and to improve mandate implementation.

One of the goals of this exercise should be to identify and agree on practical ways to operationalize deeper collaboration across entities, including through shared back office functions, joint digital hubs and other integrated services.

We should also aim at strengthening the current oversight mechanisms in place.

On funding we recognize that reliance on voluntary and earmarked contributions has increased fragmentation and limited strategic capacity.

Predictable funding is essential.

Ultimately the our aim is not to do more with less, but to achieve greater efficiency.

Modernizing our approach to maximize impact the challenge before us is on how to install a state of the art software on a heavy hardware.

Thank you very much.

I thank the distinguished PR of Ecuador.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I give the floor now to the United States Kingdom and just before she takes the floor let me advise we do have a number of other requests for the floor so we will be reconvening at3.uk you have the floor.

**United Kingdom | Representative**

Thank you Co Chairs and thank you to Jamaica and New Zealand for your continued leadership of this ad hoc working group and for the transparency and inclusiveness of of the process that you're running.

The United Kingdom reaffirms our strong support for the UNAT Initiative and the Secretary General's efforts to promote coherence, efficiency and effectiveness across the UN's three core pillars.

As this Working Group considers principles that could apply to future mandates, we again underscore the need to set the bar high, ensuring we reduce duplication and free up resources to better deliver priorities.

This will reduce the burden on all of us as Member States, but even more critically on the UN Secretariat if we improve the focus, specificity and timelines of mandates for the UN Secretariat, strengthening internal strategic coordination is essential to reducing duplication and enhancing delivery, ensuring work is assigned to the most appropriate entity.

This could be led by EOSG working in coordination with the cpc and in that regard I want to build on questions and comments made by others around understanding the SG's authority in this space.

On meetings and reports, much has been said, but from a UK perspective we support the streamlining of reports and meetings, including by reducing their length and frequency, as well as considering alternative formats.

But procedural reforms have their limits.

Proliferation is best addressed at inception and this requires collective discipline for us as Member States when we're creating these mandates.

Finally, on funding, adequate funding is critical to mandate implementation and as ever, this issue is best addressed by Member States paying assessed contributions in full and on time and without conditions.

With regards to voluntary funding, I was struck by USG Rider's slide around small grants and the administrative burden related to that and that point is well made and I think on pooled funding the UK is very much in support of pooled funding, specifically in the humanitarian space.

Finally, we welcome the recent issuance of the UNAT Work Plan and hope that this will help build the links between the three work strands.

Thank you.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the United Kingdom.

I give the floor to Cuba.

**Cuba | Representative**

Thank you Co Chairs, we appreciate this news opportunity to discuss proposals regarding the implementation of mandates under the UN 80 initiative.

Cuba aligns itself with the Declaration of Iraq on behalf of the Group of USD and China and would like to make the following observations in national capacity.

We emphasize that as stated in the follow up information to the consultation on October 30, decisions on which reports should be prioritized, combined or simplified must be studied on case by case basis, taking into account the level of political sensitivity and consequently the volume of information needed for the consideration of a given issue.

We also believe that the Unity Initiative is an opportunity to improve the report preparation process, including the review of information sources and other aspects that contribute to the reports providing a comprehensive reflection of reality.

Co Chairs, we recognize the need to advance in the search of efficiencies that will enable the entities to across the system to be in a better position to fulfill their mandate.

However, we do not favor the relocation of resources without the proper approval of the General Assembly.

A clear definition of what it meant by reasonable justification is needed as granting in a given entity greater flexibility under such an ambiguous term could lead to arbitrary decisions.

In that case, the prerogative of Member States will be relegated.

Furthermore, we reiterate that we have doubts about how to approach these proposals given that the budget responds to a program plan previously defined by the Member States.

Thank you so much.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

Thank you Cuba. I give the floor to the distinguished DPR of France, who will be the final speaker in the this morning's session.

**France | DPR**

Thank you Mr. Co Chair and all protocol observes.

I'll do the short version of my speech and to add three remarks in complement of the European Union statement with which France aligns itself.

First, we fully support the implementation of leaner, clearer and more agile mandate delivery process.

This starts with the assignment of tasks.

We strongly encourage the Security Secretary General to designate a single lead entity for mandate implementation each time mandates allow it.

Second, we need to frame our dialogue on mandate financing around increased responsibility and flexibility.

As Member States, we have a double responsibility.

First, to honor our financial commitments in time and in full, but second, to acknowledge that some mandates can actually be implemented within existing resources and some of them require additional resources.

And on the second point, I think our discussions show that we need to have more regular exchanges with the Secretariat on the funding of mandates, and France would support exploring avenues for more flexible use of resources by the Secretariat in order to make the best possible use of the organization's workload absorption capacity.

Third, and finally, France calls for an enhanced dialogue between Member States and the Secretariat on mandate results, performance and evaluation.

During a previous meeting and also today, USG Guy Rider shared insightful information on the organization's marginal costs for additional reports or additional meetings, which could provide a useful starting point in this regard.

Benchmarks with other international organizations could be mobilized, for example, for the presentations.

Sorry, in the presentations by Secretary to this ad hoc working group and for example on AI in interpretation, which is widely used at the European Parliament or for some international conferences to end, France remains fully committed to supporting the Secretary General's drive forward on this important work stream.

Tetra finances.

**IAHWG | Brian Wallace | Co-Chair**

I thank the distinguished DPR of France who was the last speaker in this session.

We will resume at 3 to hear the remaining speakers.

The meeting is adjourned.
