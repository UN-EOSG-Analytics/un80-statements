# Session 6 | Mandate Implementation consultations - Statements from members of the working group – Part 2 (Nov 14, 2025) 

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

Colleagues, can I ask you to take your seats as I call to order this meeting of the informal Ad hoc Working Group on Mandate Implementation Review.
We will resume where we Left off at 1 o' clock today with the remaining list of speakers, and I will begin by giving the floor to the representative of Costa Rica.

**Costa Rica | Representative**

Thank you very much.
Dear co facilitators, Co chairs, I'm sorry.
It's great to see you coordinating our works and congratulations from my delegation for all the work you have done so far.
Excellencies, Dear distinguished colleagues, we are operating in a context of growing financial pressures that affect the predictability required for effective mandate delivery.
This reality underscores the need to strengthen responsible financing, governance and administration so that the United nations can continue to fulfill the mandates entrusted to it.
Mandate implementation is where credibility is tested.
Allow me to highlight three points and four possible step forwards.
First, the reporting burden continues to expand, largely because we Member States continue to request new reports.
Costa Rica supports a careful review of periodicities, duplications and mandates whose reporting requirements may be no longer necessary.
The goal is to improve the quality, usefulness and timeliness of reporting.
While each committee has its own dynamics, more deliberate planning and sequencing of meeting time between bureaus and the Secretariat can support more effective workload management, acknowledging that only part of the cost structure is truly adjustable.
Second, a more coherent United nations requires stronger system wide coordination.
Clarifying the division of labor on the basis of comparative advantage can reduce overlap and increase impact.
For Costa Rica, this must be guided by transparent and more inclusive intergovernmental oversight across the UN system as a whole, particularly in the funds and programs and within the governance of their executive boards.
Coordination efforts should respect established governance arrangements while also identifying areas where those arrangements could be refined to support more coherent planning and delivery.
Third, mandate implementation, budgeting and liquidity are inseparable.
Persistent cash constraints require responsible forms of flexibility within existing governance frameworks.
Better internal reprogramming, a better a more strategic use of existing reserve and more coherent resource planning across related clusters can help sustain operations and reduce fragmentation.
Pool or joint mechanisms may also help reduce structural competition for resources.
Looking ahead, Costa Rica supports first, a focused mandate implementation dialogue, a more comprehensive one and a continuous one.
Second, evidence based reviews of reporting cycles.
Third, assessments of the cost implications of different reporting and meeting models, modalities and fourth, an annual exchange with the Secretariat to better align mandates, capacities and resources.
Costa Rica remains committed to a United nations that is coherent, efficient and capable of delivering the results that the international community expects.
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank Costa Rica.
I give the floor now to Indonesia and then we will have Germany, Algeria, Kyrgyzstan, Senegal and Norway.
Indonesia, you have the floor.

**Indonesia | Representative**

Thank you. Co Chairs Indonesia extends appreciation to you for the inclusive, transparent and constructive engagement in the continuation of this process.
We also thank all briefers for the responses and also for the presentation last week.
Today's discussion on mandate implementation is among the utmost importance of the overall process.
This is the point where decisions taken are translated into real change on the ground.
It is where expectations must turn into action and where the true effectiveness of the United nations is ultimately measured.
Allow us to share our two key reflections on today's topic.
First, on the design of the reports.
From the last briefing, we noted a persistent pattern that a significant portion of reports are recurring, yet those do not always yield new or meaningful values.
Indonesia believes that future reports must shift from repetition to relevance and offering deeper insights in a more comprehensive and measurable way.
In this regard, we are of the view that areas of improvement could be applied to the report designs, such as maintaining a similar structure of reports on targeted focus with updated contents in its issuance of reports, that this will enable us to track progress and identify gaps.
Meanwhile, emerging issues could be highlighted in a separate chapter with brief details.
Second, on the issue of overlapping mandate citations, while entities might cite similar mandates, a similar citation does not necessarily mean similar implementation in practice.
Entities may apply the same mandate to different regions, constituencies or operational contexts.
We therefore need a mechanism that traces the end use of these mandates, clarifying what activities are undertaken, where they occur and with what concrete impacts.
The function parameters presented in the response to the last briefing, ranging from normative support and policy advice to data capacity building and service delivery, could be a starting point as practical tools to map complementarities and reduce unnecessary duplication.
Co Chairs to conclude, rest assured that Indonesia stands ready to engage constructively to ensure mandate implementation remains purposeful, coherent and impactful.
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank Indonesia.
Give the floor now to Germany and then Algeria.

**Germany | Representative**

Co Chairs Colleagues, Germany fully aligns with the statement made by the EU this morning.
We thank you again, Co Chairs, for your leadership and for organizing the very insightful briefing on mandate implementation.
Building on what we learned from our great briefers, I would like to make three points in my national capacity.
First, on reports and meetings.
As others have already outlined, we also think that we need to address the proliferation of meetings and reports.
Since 1990, the amount of reports has increased by about 20%.
Why not, as a first step, cut the comparable 20% and get back to the level of 9090 when it comes to the amount of reports.
Secondly, on internal oversight, one important task is to address the poor division of labor within the UN system that can lead to duplication and also to the misallocation of funds.
We should strengthen the internal strategic planning and where appropriate, accompanied by independent internal and external oversight.
The goal should be to ensure that UN entities only work on implementation of those mandates for which they have tangible comparative advantages and of course, in a well coordinated manner.
Thirdly, and lastly, Co Chairs, let me make a broader point on the UNH spirit.
Germany very much appreciates the deliberations and the exchange in this Working Group under the able leadership of you, dear Co Chairs.
If we want the reform to be successful, we as Member States need to fully embrace the Unit spirit.
Also, outside this room and this Working Group, the current Committee season provides the perfect opportunity to do so.
For instance, in the First Committee, France and Germany made some proposals how to make the work in that Committee more efficient.
Specific ideas include reduced time for statements and meetings and only submitting draft resolutions if there is a substantial change.
That's just one example.
I'm sure other delegations and other committees might come up with even better and bolder ideas.
But that kind of practical application could in turn feed back into this room and this Working Group.
By that, we, the Member States, could fully embrace the UNAT spirit in our everyday Committee work and of course, continue our work here in the Working Group, aiming at high ambitious results under your leadership.
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank Germany for its statement.
I give the floor now to Algeria, followed by Kyrgyzstan.

**Algeria | Representative**

Thank you for giving me the floor.
Algeria aligns itself with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of G77 and China and welcomes the opportunity to engage constructively in the ongoing discussions on unity.
We share the collective aspiration for a United nations that is more coherent, more coordinated and more responsive.
In this regard, we have taken note of proposals that could allow the Secretariat to set or adjust priorities on the basis of internal consideration.
We wish to reiterate that the strategic direction of the Organization is determined exclusively by Member States.
Mandates, whether political, peacekeeping, humanitarian or development related, cannot be recalibrated due to financial constraints or operational pressures.
Their implementation is not discretionary, nor can it be delayed or reshaped outside of intergovernmental decisions.
We also recognize the value of enhancing efficiency and fostering innovation in reporting and resolution making.
However, these efforts must not weaken Member States ability to exercise their work.
What is required is improved analytical depth, clearer methodologies for the preparation of reports, more rigorous self evaluation by the Secretariat and increased transparency.
We need to make the best of the accumulated institutional knowledge that the organization has gathered through its 80 years of existence.
Furthermore, reforms that affect Africa must be undertaken in close consultation with African states, the African Union, and regional organizations that hold direct responsibilities in peace, security and development on the continent.
Inclusion and partnership are indispensable for a credible and sustainable reform process.
In this regard, we caution against any measures that could negatively impact peace, security and development in Africa, and recall that the United nations bears a historical responsibility toward the continent, one that this reform process must uphold and strengthen, not depart from.
Finally, we underscore the importance of Excuse me, we underscore the importance of maintaining coherence across all UNH work streams.
Decisions taken in one area, whether structural, operational or budgetary, inevitably affect mandate implementation in others.
To avoid fragmented or unintended outcomes, the process must be considered and managed holistically, with a full appreciation of its interdependences.
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank Algeria for her statement.
I give the floor now to Kyrgyzstan and then Senegal.

**Kyrgyzstan | Representative**

Thank you. Co Chairs Excellencies.
Let me begin by thanking the Co Chairs for convening this important meeting and for their continued efforts to advance the reform of the United Nations.
Today, the United nations stand at a decisive moment.
The UNAT reform must be more than an administrative exercise.
It must help the organization act faster, work smarter and deliver better Results.
With the UN system resources expected to decrease by almost 1/4 by 2026, we cannot afford excessive bureaucracy.
We must focus on what truly effective, coordinated and accountable implementation of mandates.
Kyrgyzstan believes that the success of reform depends on our ability to to strengthen cooperation among UN aid entities.
We need to reduce duplication, improve coordination, and ensure that every mandate has clear objectives and measurable impact.
The UN should move from fragmented and parallel efforts toward a more integrated and complementary approach, especially across the peace, development and humanitarian pillars.
Financing remains a central challenge.
Kyrgyzstan supports proposals to better align new mandates with realistic financial resources.
Efficiency means not doing more with less, but doing better with what we have in a focused and measurable way.
We must also make reporting a tool for management, not bureaucracy.
Too many reports are rarely used.
We need shorter, more digital and analytical reports that help decision making and strengthen accountability.
Kyrgyzstan also wishes to highlight the situation of small and developing countries.
Many of us with limited staff and small permanent missions face challenges in following numerous meetings and processes.
Full engagement of all member states, regardless of size or capacity, is essential for a fair and representative United Nations.
At the heart of these reforms must remain the human dimension.
The real measure of UN success lies in its ability to prevent conflict, build peace and include people.
In these efforts, we emphasize preventive diplomacy, regional cooperation and inclusive peace building that fully engage women and youth as agents of stability and resilience.
Co Chairs we stand at a historic crossroads.
The choice is ours to remain constrained by outdated procedures or to rise as a force for decisive and principled actions.
Kyrgyzstan calls and all Member States to show political will, vision and courage so that the unity reform becomes a true turnpoint leading to an organization that acts swiftly, clearly and in service of all people.
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank Kyrgyzstan for the statement.
I give the floor now to Senegal to be followed by Norway.

**Senegal | Representative**

Thank you. Dear Co Chair Dear Co Chairs, the delegation of Senegal aligns itself with the statements delivered by Iraq and Singapore respectively on behalf of the G77 and China and a small States group and would like to share the following points on its national capacity.
My delegation thanks the Under Secretary General Ryder for his constant engagement to ensure ownership of this process by Member States and commend you Co Chairs for your efforts to create this opportunity of information and dialogue.
You can continue to count on our full support.
Firstly, my delegation encouraged efforts in terms of mandate monitoring tools, particularly the development of register of mandates, putting its and artificial intelligence to better contribution.
This kind of registry should help us have that global perspective of existing mandates and of primary responsible entities with a view to identify obsolete or dormant mandates, overlaps or duplicates prior to the generation of new mandates.
This mandate inventory should also serve to a better identification of implementing bodies, clarification of the rules and mission of entities involved in the implementation of cross cutting mandates, assessment of necessary budgetary and human resources, as well as advancing possibilities for financing through existing budgetary lines.
In current programs about financing, the payment of assets contribution in due time remains critical for well implemented mandates.
Nonetheless, this process can also nourish our reflections on how to defragment the resources available within the organization, including through the fungibility of voluntary contribution.
Secondly, in line with the steps taken through the United Nations General assembly resolution 793 to 7 on revitalization of the work of the General assembly, formulation of mandates should be strengthened through concise, action oriented and time bound resolutions.
This kind of approach shall form part of a revitalized coordination between the Secretariat mandated entities, Member State and other stakeholders with a view to discuss in a timely manner ways to create synergies between similar mandates and deciding on adjustments, mergers or elimination as appropriate.
In this respect, the review of periodicity, length and format of reports should be considered in a way to give sufficient and efficient time to stakeholders to implement the mandates to take stock of the difficulties of implementation and to provide prospects for improvement and amendments.
Finally, the issue of the implementation of mandates speaks to their cycle of life from creation to termination.
One part of our challenge is also to give meaning to what that termination would be, whether through a plain and simple conclusion or through a form of continuation via another vehicle of action.
By doing that, we will also help reconcile competing and overlapping lines of actions.
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank the representative of Senegal for the statement.
I now give the floor to Norway, to be followed by Angola.

**Norway | Representative**

Thank you coaches and thank you to the brief.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

Before we before Norway takes the floor, I'd just like to say thank you to USG Rider who has to leave for another engagement with the Secretary General.
Thank you so much for being here with us and I'll give the floor back to Norway.

**Norway | Representative**

Thank you, thank you, thank you co chairs and thank you to the briefers for today.
Norway particularly appreciates the clarity of the mandate delivery chapter on the SD report that informs our discussions today.
Given that we're already into the afternoon session, I'll just focus on one particular aspect on reporting.
We strongly support the Secretary General's proposals and prerogatives to prioritise and streamline requests and mandates for reports or meetings, recognizing the urgent need to modernise how the UN designs, manages and delivers data and information.
As we heard this morning, the current culture of extensive reports to documentation and frequent meetings consume significant resources both for those producing them and for us, the Member States that receive them.
With more than half of all active mandates requiring reports, most of them recurring and unevenly read, we should use this as an opportunity to step back and rethink how we as Member States are best served in terms of information sharing and accountability.
Could we envision a future UN without formal reports instead of moving to digital systems, perhaps through an integrated UN digital platform?
One offering a new kind of reporting with up to date multilingual access to visualized data which presents concise information and analysis rather than static written yearly updates?
Could it perhaps also provide a snapshot of progress made on mandate implementation, including associated budgets from across the UN system?
A new kind of digital visualization of information and analysis could be a valuable tool to enable evidence based decision making when we come to mandate renewals and hopefully improve coordination across UN entities.
We welcome other concrete ideas that were presented by colleagues this morning, like the standard templates for drafting mandates as suggested by Singapore.
Or does it explore further ideas like cooling off periods for mandates as suggested by Mexico?
We also, in closing, wanted to echo the comments from the UK this morning on the importance of core funding, another key challenge outlined in the SG's report.
Norway will expand on these ideas and others in our written inputs.
Thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

I thank Norway for your statement.
I give the floor now to Angola who is the last speaker on our list.

**Angola | Representative**

Thank you Mr. Chair for giving this delegation the floor.
Co Chairs Angola appreciates the organizer and all contributors engaged in advancing this critical discussion.
Angola aligns with statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of G77/China and wish to emphasize the following.
We recognize the effective execution of the United nations mandates requires a robust coordination across all agencies and domains.
The intercontinental nature of the organization responsibilities demands a comprehensive approach.
The UN80 initiative aims to make the UN nimbler and more effective while reducing inefficiencies and overlappings in its operations.
Any reforms should ultimately serve the goal of better mandates implementation and service outcomes.
Respecting the decision making authority of Member States guided by transparent government, government led oversight, Excellencies and Co Chairs to turn commitments into real progress, we advocate for clear, measurable objectives and continuous dialogue with Secretariats.
Member States should steer the goal setting and assessment process with Secretariat providing supportive input rather than a directive role.
While we see value in utilizing digital tools and artificial intelligence to identify inefficiencies, we stress the importance of applying these solutions judiciously and responsibly.
Safeguards are crucial to protect privacy, ensure accuracy and prevent costly errors, particularly under current budgetary constraints.
Angola also called for thorough and accessible information regarding which intergovernmental bodies are managing each mandate, along with regular updates on achievements and obstacles.
Transparency is vital to identify board necklace and driving evidence based improvements.
Finally, we insist that all entities adhere strictly to the mandates adopted by Member States, ensuring impartiality and compliance with agreed parameters.
Angola remains committed to participating transparently, inclusively and constructively in the mandate review, ensuring that United nations can meet the expectations of all its Member States.
I thank you.

**IAHWG | Co-Chair**

Thank you so much Angola.
We appreciate both your thoughtful intervention but also your patience in being the last speaker of today's session.
We started the conversation this morning with a call from one of our colleagues to have an honest conversation and dialogue.
And I think from where we're sitting up here at the front, it felt not only honest and constructive, but also substantive.
It's thoughtful.
You're being collaborative and you're really thinking about space specific ideas you can put on the table.
So thank you so much to all of you.
I will just mention a couple of things that we've heard and of course we're Feeding in your thoughts all the time into our thoughts as well.
But what we heard from a lot of you today was about the importance of improving the quality and the impact of our work.
That came through really strongly.
A lot of you made a strong connection between the relationship between mandate creation and and mandate implementation.
And there were calls by many of you to think about how we can do better when we create mandates, to make sure that implementation is more impactful.
A lot of you have given really helpful suggestions about the practical tools and processes, templates, technology, knowledge management.
This has all come through really clearly today that there seems to be a really large shared appetite to contemporise not only what we do, but the way we do our work.
A lot of you spoke about how the way we fund the organisation, finance the organisation, has an impact on implementation and others spoke to the activities that we choose to mandate.
The vast array of Secretary General reports and meetings and so forth are in fact a trade off at times to practical delivery on the ground, especially in a resource constrained environment.
So these were some of the things that I heard today.
We will go away, as we always do, and think deeply and review all your inputs that you have made to us and to each other today.
But before adjourning, as we've previously announced, we just wanted to remind you that the next meeting of the Working Group will be a briefing on mandate review and that will take place on the 25th of November and then of course will be followed by the normal pattern of consultations on 3rd of December and with that that will complete, of course, this discovery phase of our work.
We will give you, as we always do, more information on the mandate implementation implementation briefing in due course.
We mentioned it earlier, but just to remind you again as well that we have that the President of the General assembly has scheduled an informal meeting of the General assembly on 11th of December for us to provide the General assembly, us as co chairs, to provide the General assembly with an update on the work and progress of the ad hoc, informal ad hoc working Group that will help us deliver against what we're required to do with the 15 December deadline, as was required in decision 79 571.
Of course we remain here at your service.
We're really happy if you come and contact us.
You can do that directly and in person with us or with our teams.
And of course you can do it in writing, including to the email address that we've provided to you earlier, including in the 12 November letter.
So with that, again, just a warm thank you on behalf of my co chair and I, we think it was a really great session today.
And the fact you stuck with us on a Friday afternoon shows your dedication.
But with that, the meeting is adjourned.
