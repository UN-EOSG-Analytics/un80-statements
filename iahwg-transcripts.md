**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
Colleagues, if you could please be seated so that we can begin. Thank you. I call to order the first meeting of the Informal Ad Hoc Working Group. On behalf of the co chairs, I extend a warm welcome to all of you to this first meeting of the Informal Ad Hoc Working Group. I would like to recognize the presence of the President of the General Assembly, Her Excellency Annalina Baerbock and Mr. Guy Ryder, under Secretary General Policy in the Executive Office of the Secretary General.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Madam President, in our role as Co Chairs of the Informal Ad Hoc Working Group, we congratulate you on your election and wish you a fruitful 80th session of the General Assembly. As members are aware in its decision 79571 of 2 September 2025, the General assembly decided to establish an Informal Ad Hoc Working Group open to all Member States and observers to consider options to improve the creation, delivery and review of UN mandates. The establishment of this group is a milestone within the broader UN80 initiative, and new Zealand and Jamaica are honored to co chair its work. Today we gather with a clear sense of purpose to take forward the mandate entrusted to us by the Assembly. In the spirit of cooperation, openness and trust that defines multilateralism at its best, our leaders have called for a United nations that is more effective, more efficient and fit for purpose. As it marks its 80th anniversary, this working Group is one expression of that collective ambition, and it is for us, the membership, to shape how that conviction is translated into practice. We meet today to set out our understanding of the task before us and to engage with you on how we can best work together to complete it successfully. While we have some initial thoughts on how we might proceed, today is not about prescribing a roadmap. It is about listening, taking stock of your perspectives, and beginning to build a common understanding of the way forward. Mandates derive from the will of Member States, and it is vital that all delegations have the opportunity to contribute. We are therefore committed to proceeding in a manner that is fully open, transparent and inclusive, ensuring that the Working Group reflects the the broadest possible participation and ownership. At the same time, we are mindful of the Assembly's clear instruction that we must strive for consensus as we begin to prepare a program of work and plan our way forward. We are eager to hear from you so that we can be sure that our proposed approach aligns with the needs and wishes of the membership. We also recognize the many demands on delegations, particularly smaller missions, in the months ahead. And for this reason we see value in beginning with a Discovery Phase A period of wide consultations to gather perspectives, to clarify priorities and to build shared understandings. This will allow us to develop a package of principles and follow up actions that could form the basis an agreed outcome. This phase will be fully open and inclusive and organized in a way that is sensitive to the competing demands on delegation's time. We will also draw on the best data analysis and expertise available, including through active support from the Secretariat. And we thank the Under Secretary General for his firm commitment in this regard. It is also clear to us that there are many outside the Working Group who wish to contribute ideas for our collective consideration. We welcome this and will facilitate it as part of the Working Group process while preserving the Member State driven nature of our discussions. We will aim to complete this phase in time to report back to the membership by the 15th of December in line with the Assembly's request, before moving into a production phase to finalize outcomes by March 2026. With that, I now pass the floor to Ambassador Schwargov for some additional comments.

**IAHWG** | Carolyn Schwalger, Co-Chair
Thank you Ambassador Wallace and good morning everybody. President of the General Assembly Under Secretary General Guy Ryder and all of our colleagues. It's so great to see so many of you here this morning. The General assembly has given us clear direction. We are tasked with identifying principles and follow up actions to improve the creation, delivery and review of mandates. The Secretary General's report on the Mandate Implementation Review provides a useful starting point for these discussions. It provides a number of proposed solutions and follow up actions for for implementation by the UN Secretariat in support of Member States. We will invite the UN Secretariat to provide the Working Group with updates on implementation of those proposals that sit within their authority at appropriate moments during this process. The report also proposes a range of actions that Member States could take to enhance mandate design, improve mandate delivery and support mandate Review as you engage in the Working Group, we would welcome your feedback on these proposals, focusing on those actions which you consider most important to progress and or those where Member States could achieve some quick wins. We also understand that Working Group members will also have ideas of their own on concrete actions we can take beyond those proposed in the Report. We encourage you to bring these to the consideration of this Working Group. Let us also assure you that we have learned many lessons from the last mandate review almost 20 years ago. One of the key findings of that process was the impossibility of trying to have a Working Group such as this make judgments on individual mandates. As Co Chairs, we intend to focus our attention at the system level. We will not be considering individual mandates in this Working Group. Further, as Co Chairs, we think it will be important to focus on the future so that we can be more effective and efficient with with limited resources. We want to hear from you what that future might look like. How can Member States, who are responsible for the adoption of mandates, be more effective and more efficient in future? What principles should underpin how we work together as Member States to strengthen the impact of the United nations, to improve delivery across all pillars of of our work? And what principles should underpin our partnership with the Secretariat going forward? As Co Chairs, we do not intend to prejudge what the outputs of the Working Group should be or what form these might take, although we can imagine a scenario where they might involve a combination of different elements. This is for the Working Group members to determine together. We want to hear from you today and in the coming weeks about your desired level of ambition and what good might look like in terms of our outputs. We hope to forge consensus amongst Working Group members on some principles to underpin how we collectively keep better sight of the overall mandate landscape, how we deal with duplication and overlap between mandates and what we do with mandates which might have outlived their original purpose. We will be asking you how we can mitigate the unreasonable burden these aggregated instructions place on us as Member States and on the UN system, as well as what principles might underpin the creation of mandates that translate into clearer, fairer and more sustainable resource allocations. We will also need to consider how any principles and actions we agree should be applied in practice, including in relation to mandates originating in UN bodies outside of New York. With that, I would now like to pass the floor to my Co Chair, Ambassador Wallace, to outline our thinking on the relationship between the Mandate process and the wider UN80 initiative process process.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Ambassador, thank you so much. Co Chair. We acknowledge that this process will unfold in parallel with the other UN 80 work streams on operational efficiencies and structural and programmatic changes. We will therefore remain attentive to developments across the Initiative, while keeping our focus firmly on the mandate provided to this Group Group by the General Assembly. Across all of our endeavors, we will be guided by the shared aspiration of the membership for a more effective and efficient United Nations. The issues before us are significant, representing our collective strategic vision and operational expectations of the UN as a whole. This is why at this stage, engagement at the level of permanent representatives is especially important. The political vision and strategic direction you bring will provide the compass by which this process is steered. With the expertise of colleagues to follow in due course as our work becomes more technical, colleagues as co chairs, we know the discussions ahead of us will be demanding and complex. However, it is with optimism and conviction that we believe this Working Group provides an excellent opportunity to improve how the United nations delivers for the communities we serve. The strength of this Working Group will not lie in a document or a deadline, but in the quality of dialogue we foster together. If we succeed in creating a space that is constructive, candid and forward looking, we will have laid the foundation not only for this process, but for a stronger multilateral system. Let us therefore seize this moment with a sense of common purpose and shared responsibility. The United nations belongs to all of us and together we can ensure that it is equipped to meet the demands of today and the aspirations of tomorrow. We thank you for the trust you have placed in us. I now give the floor to the President of the General Assembly, Her Excellency Annalina Baerbock.

**GA** | Annalena Baerbock, PGA
Thank you, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, I'm pleased to join this inaugural meeting of the informal Ad hoc Working Group on the Mandate Implementation review under the UNAT initiative. And I thank His Excellency, Mr. Brian Wallace, Permanent Representative of Jamaica, and Her Excellency, Ms. Carlene Schwalger, Permanent Representative of New Zealand, for their leadership and for bringing us together today. I would like to also thank the Co Chairs of the revitalization process from Romania and South Africa. We have worked also closely together and this is an outcome of your excellent work. So thank you very much. And I think the presence today underlines the importance of this Working group because we are living, as we have heard, in challenging times and therefore also all of us as General assembly, do have a special responsibility in this process to take forward the Secretary General's report on mandate implementation, to distill guiding principles and to chart the next step that will make our mandates clearer, more effective and more accountable. Underlining that it's not only paper, but that it's really implementation which matters. It builds on the dialogues begun last session by my predecessor, President Philemon Yang, and takes us to the next steps in this process. And I'm also thankful to him and his team team for keeping me fully informed during the transition period. And I intend to build upon their efforts and their open door. I would like to also underline that this process of us as the General assembly is obviously part of the heart of the UNAD process on the adapting this organization for the 21st century. Ensuring that our institution, that we are really fit for the future, that we really deliver as an institution on the efficiency level but also on the state of art level, like other institutions around the world. And therefore, I would like to recall the three themes of the UN80 process. Guy Raider will definitely go deeper into it, but I think it's good, good to have it always in mind when we speak about the mandates. First, to sharpen the efficiency, which includes cutting bureaucracy, reducing cost. We have learned altogether what every minute costs here and making smarter use of our global presence. Second is the mandate review itself, ensuring the many tasks entrusted to the UN remain focused and relevant. And third, consider the system as a whole, drawing on the first two streams to assess whether deeper structural or programmatic changes are needed. So colleagues, in my opening address I spoke explicitly about this make it or break it moment, that this mandate review process is part of it, whether we make it or we break it. And therefore, I believe and would like to underline what the co chairs have said, that we should take up this topic with a positive spirit, that we together can actually make it. And that UN80 is not just an exercise in reform for reform itself. Definitely not a cut cutting exercise for just cutting cost, but it's a chance for us to make this institution better and stronger together. It is a chance to prove that the UN can deliver more effectively and accountably for the people and it serves. And the mandate review is an essential component of this because this is about us. This is where we as Member States, you and we as a GA in general can show that we are delivering, that we are leading by good examples ourselves. Less than two weeks in office and already five mandate events plus two additional high level events are on the agenda next week. So I for myself tasked myself to always think with every new mandate and every session I chair, what could I learn for the future, to make it in the future more effective and more accountable to the people. Because I believe that the organization cannot continue to layer more mandates on top of old ones, but has to focus on delivery efficiency and effectiveness. And therefore I would like to give you a very small example. When we were preparing for now the upcoming high Level Speak week, like the ceremonial event on Monday, the Beijing platform based on resolutions and people told me, especially the Secretariat, every minute counts, it costs thousands of euro, but. But then I have a resolution saying you should put 16 speakers in one hour. So this doesn't work at all. But I cannot do anything about it because it's in there in the resolution. So I think looking really at this tiny examples where we can save a lot of money but also reflect all the time, not we've done it always like it always the speaker from there and there and there and there. But just reflect how we can learn also from the past. So definitely this is not an easy undertaking because everybody loves their darlings and this is I think also something which we could reflect to look really when we are presenting things, how we can lead by good examples. Again, I'd like to underline what the co chairs have said. Obviously it's not about now and the past, but looking for the future which also gives us strength that we can deliver on this very challenging timetable. In this regard I applaud you of the timetable. Yes, it's ambitious. I've heard already that some people say it might be a bit too ambitious, but I would say if it would be easy then others could do the job. So we work on that one together so that we can deliver as best as we can. My office, the OPGA will support wherever support is needed. Also on transparency because obviously trust is the base for the work here together. So on this note I'm pleased that we were able to provide last minute also the public support for this discussion today and we are keen of keeping this transparency and the support also in the future. So thank you very much for the exchange today and I'm really looking forward of working together. On that one last mentioning, I would like to say I think it's of highest importance that this does not only stay in the room, but this is really taking up to senior level engagements. So with the high level week ahead, please prepare every head of State and minister visiting the PGA that I will double check if they have heard about UNAT before and the mandate review because obviously it is also an opportunity where we can show all together that we are not only working here together in New York, but also in the capitals in this regard. Looking forward to a great hey, Labor Week and also to a great working group. Thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the President. We have also requested Mr. Guy Ryder, under Secretary General for Policy in the Executive Office of the Secretary General to deliver some remarks on the support he and his team will be providing to this process. I now give the floor to the Under Secretary General.

**UN Secretariat** | Guy Ryder, USG Policy
Thank you very much, President of the 80th session of the General Assembly. Co Chairs of this informal ad hoc working group. Let me begin by congratulating the co chairs, Ambassador Wallace and Ambassador S.H. schwalger for their appointment to co chair this informal ad hoc working group on the UN80 initiative. Ladies and gentlemen, the Secretary General has welcomed the adoption of resolution 79318 which endorsed the overall direction of the UN 80 initiative and we have taken note of the General Assembly's encouragement to submit proposals to strengthen the impact and the agility of the United nations while reducing duplication and improving mandate delivery. And as the President of the General assembly has indicated, the 80th anniversary is an important opportunity to build on and to intensify the reforms of past years. The UN80 initiative aims to move us towards an effective and sustainable United nations and Decision 79571 established the Informal Ad Hoc Working Group and the decision establishes that the Working Group will consider in its scope the proposals contained in the Secretary General's report on the Mandate implementation review and identify principles and follow up actions in order to improve the creation, delivery and review of mandates. The timeline set out in that decision is certainly ambitious and I want to recognise your efforts in organising Co chairs this first meeting exactly two weeks after the adoption of the decision and your appointment and let me just take a moment today to speak to the proposals contained in the report by the Secretary General as a, I hope, important input to the work of this Working Group and we would gladly provide a technical briefing on specific aspects of the report if you request it. Let me speak first to the areas outlined in the report in which the Secretary General will act to improve support to Member States throughout the mandate life cycle and these are listed in the report on the Mandate Implementation Review. To enhance mandate visibility and design, the UN system would accelerate the creation of mandate registries, improve Secretariat support, develop new tools and complement existing statements of expenditures with additional information on related programmatic activities. To improve reporting, the UN system will provide shorter reports, combine reports, introduce different report formats and publish download statistics and to improve mandate delivery management, the UN system will strengthen internal oversight, review mandate citations, better use system wide coordination platform reforms and apply all UN system commitments in the Funding Compact and to establish effective review mechanisms, the UN system will increase use of existing mechanisms to identify opportunities to consolidate and to streamline work and to strengthen results based management. The United Nations Systems is working on a roadmap on how these different actions can be taken by the UN system in each of these areas and we will be able to provide you with further information on this internal roadmap if the Working Group requires it at a future meeting. If you request it, let me turn to the proposals now submitted by the Secretary General in his report on the Mandate Implementation Review that Member States may wish to consider as part of this intergovernmental process. To enhance mandate design, Member States may wish to reduce the length of mandate texts, frame mandates to allow the Secretary General appropriate flexibility and refrain from mandating new tasks without corresponding resources. To improve mandate delivery, Member States may wish to prioritise requests in mandates, fully apply all commitments by Member States through the Funding Compact and allow UN system entities greater flexibility to redeploy resources quickly and to support mandate review. Member States may wish to systematise and to reinforce mandate review mechanisms, include expiry clauses and resolutions, introduce collective reviews of mandates and streamline how mandates are discussed. Co Chairs, Distinguished delegates, in decision 79, 571, you have requested the Secretary General to provide substantive support to the Working Group as needed for the effective discharge of its mandate. As you determine how you wish to organise the work of this Working Group, the UN system is at your disposal. At the report's launch, many of you indicated that you would welcome further information on the data analysis and proposals across the mandate life cycle, and the Secretariat stands ready to provide an informal briefing on the data and insights in the report. As we recognise in the report, ultimately, Member States are own the mandates that they give to the UN system and that Member States also decide on next steps. We are here to be of assistance. In your letter inviting me to this meeting, Co Chairs, you suggested that I speak to the support the UN system can provide to the Working Group's work, such as through the provision of additional data and analysis on each of the areas from the report that I have referred to in my remarks today, the UN system stands ready to provide you with that further information as you request it. For example, with regard to what is already in the report, I indicated earlier that you could request us to provide information on internal actions that we are taking, and we can also provide further background on the proposals that the Secretary General suggested Member States might wish to consider themselves or on the date that underpins the report. That said, as I have already indicated, it is for you to determine how you wish to organise this work and we remain at the full disposal of the Working Group. I thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the Under Secretary General. I now open the floor for statements by delegations. Please press the microphone button if you wish to speak. Please approach the Secretariat if you are speaking on behalf of a group of States. Participants are reminded that statements are limited to five minutes for statements on behalf of groups and three minutes for statements in your national capacity. Participants are also reminded to send their statement via the E Submit module on the Edelegate Platform. Platform it's now my honour to give the floor to the Permanent Representative of Iraq, Speaking for the G77, the floor is yours.

**IRQ**, Permanent Representative
President of General Assembly Under Secretary General Excellencies Co Chairs I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the group of 77 and China. @ the onset, allow me to congratulate both of you. Her Excellency Caroline Schwalga and Permanent Representative of New Zealand and His Excellency Mr. Brian Wallace, permanent Representative of Jamaica, on your appointment as Co Chairs of the Informal Ad Hoc Working Group on the Mandate Implementation Review and the Work Stream 2 of the UN 80 initiative. The group looks forward to working closely with you and we welcome that Our first meeting is dedicated to setting the tone of of the process. The group views the UN8 initiative as an important step towards strengthening the role of the United nations in addressing global challenges. We stress that any proposal under this Initiative and its three work streams must fully respect the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United nations as well as the intergovernmental nature of the organization. The UN 80 process should reinforce, not dilute, multilateralism, ensure equitable participation of all Member States and address the priorities and concerns of developing countries. The Group reaffirms the importance of learning from the past experiences to avoid repeating previous mistakes. The earlier exercise, conducted about two decades ago, required significant effort but yielded limited results. In this regard, the Group request a detailed briefing by the Secretary on that process, which extended over several years. It would further assist in ensuring that the informal Ad hoc Working Group fully benefits the from prior lessons learned. It's therefore crucial to build on the outcomes of every review process undertaken so far in order to prevent duplications of effort in a process that is itself aimed at avoiding redundancy. We must build upon what has already been agreed on to ensure our collective effort are not wasted. The Group underlines three guiding principles. First, the spirit of consensus. Second, Member State driven decision making and third, maintaining balance among the three pillars of the United nations. With development as a parity. The Group underscores the importance of ensuring that the establishment and work plan of the Ad Hoc Working Group are conducted in a manner that allows for meaningful and inclusive deliberations. We therefore support adopting a flexible timeline for its meetings, taking into account the concern of Member States, particularly given that the main segment of the General assembly is already a period of intense engagement across the Preliminary and its six main Committees. Such flexibility would help create a more conducive environment for constructive discussions and allow all delegations to participate effectively, including smaller ones. Further, the Group underscored the importance of ensuring that negotiations and decision making processes are conducted in an open, transparent and inclusive manner through established intergovernmental arrangements, norms and procedures. We trust that the future consideration of such important matters will be pursued on the basis of broad consultations, consensus and shared ownership among all Member States. The group of 77 in China will also submit written responses to the Co Chair's guiding questions, underscoring our readiness to engage substantively in the next stages of the process. To conclude, the group of 77 in China stresses that this first meeting is an important opportunity to set a constructive tone and to help shape a positive spirit for this process. The Group reiterates its commitment to engage constructively and to ensure that this process remains inclusive, transparent and efficient with the full participation of all Member States. I thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the Permanent Representative of Iraq and I now give the floor to the Permanent Representative of Singapore, speaking on behalf of a Group of Students States.

**SGP**, Permanent Representative
Thank you very much. Co Chairs, I have the honor to make this statement on behalf of the Small States Group ssg, which is a cross regional grouping of small States comprising developed and developing countries. The list of countries that have aligned with this statement will be circulated after the meeting, but I'm pleased to inform members that this statement is supported by a group of 50 countries and we anticipate that more small States will join future statements within this Working Group. The Small States Group welcomes the establishment of this informal Ad Hoc Working Group on Mandate Implementation Review. We take this opportunity to congratulate the two Co Chairs on the appointment and we have every confidence that both of you will lead the process to a successful outcome for small States. An Effective Multilateralism A multilateral system underpinned by respect for the UN Charter and international law is not an option, but an existential necessity. The 80th anniversary of the founding of the UN is therefore not only a moment for reflection about the future of our multilateral system, it is also an opportunity to reform and re energize the un. It is no secret that the multilateral system is under severe stress as a result of geopolitical tensions, economic fragmentation and unilateralism. The establishment of this Working Group is therefore a timely and essential exercise to reposition the UN and streamline its work to deliver results for all our countries. We wish to make three points. First, the Ad Hoc Working Group is a Member States driven process. It is therefore entirely in our hands to review all aspects of the mandate lifecycle as a means to reimagine and reposition the UN and to avoid duplication, enhance efficiency and deliver results on the ground. There's no doubt that all three streams of the UN 80 initiative are interconnected and the success of this process will have an impact on the other two work streams. With the use of new AI tools, we are better positioned to make sense of the UN mandates landscape in all parts of the UN ecosystem. At this early stage of this process, we believe it is important to keep an open mind, not rule anything out and allow for a discussion of all proposals and perspectives. Secondly, the ad hoc working group should be forward looking and ambitious while avoiding the pitfalls and politicization that plagued previous UN reform efforts. While we should be ambitious, we should avoid an all or nothing approach. It is important that we take an incremental and pragmatic approach that can show results in this regard. Our work in this process must be based on data and analyses on the UN's mandates landscape which will provide evidence based insights on how best to move forward. Ultimately, our objective is to achieve the effective implementation of mandates while avoiding duplication and inefficiencies. In this regard, our process will strengthen the three pillars of the UN system so that it can deliver what has been agreed and adopted. Thirdly, the success of this Working group depends on political will and mutual trust among Member States. In this regard, we as a group of small States are committed to participating constructively to finding solutions and to build consensus. We are encouraged by the fact that all Member States have acknowledged the need for a more efficient and stronger UN system. This gives us hope that we can collectively find solutions for the benefit of all our countries and people quotas. The UN 80 initiative is an opportunity to imagine a better future for the multilateral system. In order for the UN to continue serving its purpose and our peoples, Member States must take responsibility in reshaping the mandate system which lies at the heart of how the UN functions and works. We stand ready to work with the Co Chairs and with all Member States on achieving a meaningful mandate implementation review in line with the objectives of birth. Thank you very much for your attention.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the Permanent Representative of Singapore speaking for the Small States Group. And I now give the floor to the representative of guinea speaking for the African Group. The floor is yours.

**GIN**, Representative
Thank you. Co Chairs, Excellencies, I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the African Group. At the outset, we wish to congratulate Ambassador Caroline Schwalger from New Zealand and Ambassador Brian Wallace from Jamaica on their recent appointment as Co Chairs. We are confident in your leadership and abilities to steer our collective effort with utmost transparency and inclusivity, adhering to establishing the governmental norms and procedures that underpin this process, aligning with the statement from the Permanent Representative of Iraq on behalf of the group of 77 and China, the African Group wishes to make a few additional remarks. We recognize the urgent need to streamline mandates to alleviate unnecessary administrative burdens on the United Nations. The effectiveness of any reforms must enhance the Organization's responsiveness to the diverse priorities and pressing needs of Member States and the population we serve. While we collectively recognize the importance of to enhancing mandate implementation and streamlining outputs, it is imperative that the core mandates across all three pillars of the United nations, particularly the Development Pillar, are preserved. The Working Group should remain open and receptive to a broader array of ideas beyond those outlined in the Secretary General's Report. Moreover, it is crucial to adopt a realistic and focused approach when establishing meaningful and achievable targets. While ambition is important, it must align with existing realities to avoid repeating past failures in achieving intended outcomes. The Working Group should not duplicate the work of existing bodies. Rather, it should leverage those forums to address specific aspects, thereby allowing the Working Group to concentrate on its core objectives. Furthermore, while the Secretariat plays a vital role in advancing efficiencies, intergovernmental organs must safeguard the integrity of mandates as outlined by the UN Secretary General. Reform efforts should should proceed with full authority and oversight from Member States, ensuring transparency and inclusivity. Our discussion must be guided by foundational principles. Establishing realistic and achievable time frames is essential for interactive and constructive dialogues. This will enable meaningful deliberation without the pressure of rushed timelines. It is vital for the Working Group to be cognizant of the fact that many Member States will be actively engaged in the work of various committees and other processes which may hinder their ability to follow multiple discussions simultaneously. A Member State driven approach will enhance the quality of our discussions, fostering creativity and innovation in addressing pressing issues. We must cultivate a culture of consensus in decision making, promoting collaboration and valuing diverse viewpoints. To effectively organize the agenda of the Working Group, we propose a phased instructor approach that allows an in depth examination of key issues. Allocating adequate time for each phase is crucial for meaningful engagement. Additionally, the agenda should reflect the priorities of all Member States while retaining the flexibility to adapt to evolving needs. Implementing regular review points will facilitate the assessment of our progress and recalibrate discussions, ensuring a steadfast commitment to consensus and collaboration. In conclusion, the African Group is committed to actively and constructively participating in the discussions of the informal ad hoc Working Group on the mandate implementation Review. I thank you for your attention.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the representative of guinea speaking for the African Union. And I now give the floor to the representative of the European Union. The floor is yours.

**EU**, Representative
Thank you, Madam Chair, Madam President or the General Assembly. Mr. Undersecretary General Dear Co Chairs, I have the honor to speak on behalf of the European Union and its member states. The candidate countries, Turkey, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania, Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Georgia, as well as Armenia, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino, align themselves with this statement at the outset, Allow me to thank the President of the General assembly for her important presence here today and to congratulate the permanent representatives of Jamaica and New Zealand on their appointments as Co Chairs of this informal ad hoc working group. Dear Colleagues, you can count on the EU's full support to your work. The European Union's member states are firmly committed to multilateralism and we are among the UN's leading political supporters and funders. It is precisely because of this commitment that we engage in the UN80 process, recognizing it is a unique opportunity to build a stronger United nations, an organization where its members can make informed decisions, translate these into effective mandates, and ensure the organization efficiently can deliver real impact on the ground for the people it serves, especially for those furthest behind. There is broad recognition that the mandate process has grown unwieldy and that we must look at this with renewed clarity of purpose. We trust that under your guidance, this Working Group can help us review and streamline mandates, improve the creation and delivery, and increase accountability for impact. This will set us on a path that strengthens the UN for the future. In answering the questions that you have posed and following your guidance on how to best structure our discussion, allow me to share the European Union's views as on the question of how to make our discussions interactive, constructive and inclusive, the EU strongly supports a process that is open, transparent and participatory, where every voice can be heard and every delegation has a genuine role to play. We believe that both informal dialogues and more structured meetings, regular opportunities for cross regional exchanges, and the early involvement of the Secretariat's expertise will be essential to keep discussions focused and constructive while ensuring that all perspectives are taken into account. We would also encourage you to reach out to UN global hubs outside of New York to collect the fullest possible perspective on on mandate reform. The Secretary General's and the Secretariat's expertise and analyses will be crucial in helping us make informed choices, improve efficiency and maximize the impact of our collective work. Therefore, we should welcome the Secretariat's readiness to bring its full potential to bear under our guidance so that together we can succeed for the organization as a whole. On the question of the organization of work and sequencing of discussions, we welcome Considering a phased approach, listening widely, consulting deeply and reflecting carefully, including in cross regional settings before moving into more prescriptive text based negotiations will help us all build a better understanding of the work ahead and of different initial ideas and concerns with an open mind and thus help us make more informed and consensual choices. We see merit in organizing the initial period around thematic clusters such as Principles for the Mandate lifecycle, options for improving mandate creation and review, and approaches to implementation so that deliberations can progress in a logical sequence leading into your Progress report by 15 December 2025. On the question of addressing the Secretary General's mandate Implementation Review Report and its recommendations, the EU believes the Working Group should focus on identifying systemic improvements and translating them into practical, results oriented outcomes. At the same time, we should situate our work within the broader context of the UNAD initiative to ensure coherence and to avoid duplication. In our view, a balanced approach drawing on the Secretariat's analytical input, past reform experiences and the priorities outlined in the Pact of the Future will give this group the opportunity to agree on principles as well as specific and concrete actions that can leave a lasting legacy that will guide the organization for years to come. To repeat what we said from the very beginning of this process, in our view at least, the Pact should be our what and the UNAD our how for for guiding the UN's reform and future action. In closing, Co Chairs, the European Union and its Member States stand ready at all levels to support you in this endeavor. We are committed to working with you and with all delegations to turn this process into genuine collective success. Together we can ensure that the UN is more effective and efficient, better equipped for the challenges of today and prepared for the demands of tomorrow. Thank you.

I thank the Permanent Representative of the European Union and I now give the floor to the Permanent Representative of Palau speaking for AOCs.

**PLW**, Permanent Representative
The floor is yours, Madam President. USG Rider distinguished CO Chairs, I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the alliance of Small Island States aoc. We align with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of the group of 77 in China and wish to provide the following additional views that are specific to small island developing States at the outset. AUSSIS extends our sincere congratulations to you Co Chairs on your appointment for this important process. We're particularly pleased to see a fellow sids as well as a very good friend of sids leading our Working Group and you can count on our support and cooperation. Distinguished CO Chairs as We mark the 80th anniversary of the United Nations, AOC sees this process as a vital opportunity to reaffirm the UN Charter while modernizing the organization's capacity to deliver for those who need it most, particularly sids. Now allow me to respond to the three guiding questions before us. First, on ensuring that our discussions are interactive, constructive, and inclusive. As many of our members are represented by small delegations, convening meetings of the Working Group in parallel with those of the General Assembly's main Committees during the main session will inevitably prevent us from engaging meaningfully in the process. Therefore, in order to ensure maximum participation by all delegations, efforts should be made to avoid scheduling meetings of the Working Group at the same time as the plenary meetings of the main Committees. We also urge the CO Chairs to ensure early and transparent scheduling and circulation of background materials and to consider organizing most of the substantive work after the conclusion of the main session to ensure that we can all contribute fully to this important work. Second, on organizing and sequencing our discussions While AOC prefers to begin the more substantive aspects of our work after the main session, we also recognize the CO Chair's mandate. In the interim. We believe that the Working Group could focus its effort on more thematic decision discussions guided by the three core areas of the Secretary General's Mandate Implementation Review Report. These sessions would allow Member States to better understand the proposals under consideration, identify key questions, seek clarification and additional data from the report's authors where needed, and provide targeted inputs that can shape the direction of the review. The goal during this initial phase should be to create a common understanding of the issues, identify areas of convergence, and lay the foundation for our more substant extent of work in 2026. Third, on addressing the Secretary General's recommendations in the broader context of the UN80 initiative. As indicated in our earlier statements, AUSIS welcomes the Secretary General's commitment to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the UN system. The acknowledgement in his Mandate Implementation Review Report of systemic challenges such as fragmented implementation and uneven capacities are acutely felt by sids. At the same time, reform should also preserve investments in programs that serve the most vulnerable. Investment and development mandates, including those supporting the implementation of the Antigua and Barbuda agenda for sids should not be deprioritized under the guise of restructuring. As such, AOC stresses that the Working Group's focus to consider proposals to review or realign mandates should aim to enhance the UN's ability to deliver on the mandates themselves and not result in reducing support for developing countries, particularly sids. Ultimately, realignment must translate into improved mandate delivery for the people and countries who rely on the un. The most distinguished Co Chairs. In closing, AUSS stands ready to engage constructively with you and Member States through the group of 77 to ensure transparent, inclusive and Member States journey and process that strengthens the UN's delivery for all. I thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the Permanent Representative of Palau speaking for aosis. And I now give the floor to the Permanent Representative of Kuwait speaking for the gcc. The floor is yours. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, I hate to interrupt you, but I am very sorry to inform you that the Working Group is not supported by translation. I know this puts you in a really difficult position. Where is Kuwait? I can't see you.

**KWT**, Permanent Representative
Madam Co Chair, if I may add, I did check previously and I was told that there will be translation today. But nonetheless it may be the case that we will have to send our statement then in English.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
Sure. I am also very happy to give you a moment if you wanted to think about presenting your key points to us in English. So please let us know if you'd like to take the floor again. We'll give you a moment to do that. And again, on behalf of the Co Chairs, we really apologise for that misfortunate miscommunication.

**KWT**, Permanent Representative
Thank you, Madam Chair.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
Okay, please let us know. All right, I'll now take the next speaker on our list. And I give the floor to the Permanent Representative of Belize speaking for caricom.

**BLZ**, Permanent Representative
Thank you, Madam Co Chair. Madam President, USG Rider and Co Chairs. I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the 14 member states of the Caribbean Community. We align ourselves with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of the group of 77 in China and the statement delivered by Palau on behalf of the alliance of Small Island States. Let me offer to both of you caricom's heartfelt congratulations on your appointment and assure you of our constructive engagement in this process. CARICOM recalls its statement of 1st August on UN80 in in which we emphasize the need for clear, practical and equitable modalities that reflect the priorities of all Member States. We underscored the imperative to deliver better results for people and planet anchored in adequate resourcing system, wide efficiency and above all, equity. This holds true for the Mandate Implementation Review Co Chairs guided by these principles, CARICOM offers the following observations on your helpful guidance questions. First, on building an inclusive process, the informal ad hoc working group process must ensure the full and meaningful participation of all delegations, especially smaller ones like ours. Transparency, predictability and timely sharing of documents are essential to enable equitable engagement with with regard to engendering interactive approaches, we urge the avoidance of overlaps with main committees and plenary debates. As just pointed out by eosis, structured but flexible engagement formats, including short interventions, focused clusters and informal exchanges can facilitate more interactive and inclusive discussions regarding the sequencing of work. CARICOM urges that meetings early in the 80th session allow for robust Member States input as well as the provision of necessary data and analysis to inform our discussions and we thank USG Rider for offering the Secretariat support in that regard. With this in mind and appreciating intimate connection across all UN80 work streams, we recommend an early mapping of the Secretary General's recommendations to identify priority areas for for collective attention, the CO Chairs could undertake a sequence approach, beginning with practical and cross cutting issues such as registries, reporting and financing, followed by thematic discussions on mechanisms like expiry clauses and review modalities. We stress the importance of regular stock taking, ensuring Member States perspectives Guide the Coaches progress report in December of course CARICOM reaffirms the centrality of Member States authority over mandates reforms must preserve their prerogatives and must not dilute well established commitments and here we emphasize in particular those critical to small island developing States. With regards to the UN Secretary General's report, we welcome aspects of the Secretary General's Mandate Implementation Review Report that enhance visibility and accessibility while providing safeguards for equity and oversight in areas such as artificial intelligence. While we support greater efficiency, we have emphasized that it must never come at the expense of impact or equity for our countries. Like other small island and low lying coastal states, accountability must go beyond aggregate system wide metrics to reflect the unique vulnerabilities and development needs of sids. In closing, thank you very much Co Chairs and we look forward to engaging with you throughout this process.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the Permanent Representative of Belize speaking for caricom and I now give the floor to the Permanent Representative of Australia speaking for Cairns.

**AUS**, Permanent Representative
Thank you very much indeed Chair and congratulations to both Co Chairs on their appointment. This has been very significant as an exercise. Thank you President of the General assembly for joining us this morning and also to USG Guy Ryder. I have the honour to speak, as you mentioned, on behalf of Canada, New Zealand and my own delegation Australia. We welcome the establishment of this informal ad hoc working group to develop principles and actions to improve the creation, delivery and review of mandates. Today represents an important step in taking forward the UN 80 initiative process, and we're delighted to be in such capable hands and have great confidence in your leadership. Our delegations acknowledge that the United nations is under pressure, demands for delivery are high and the financial situation is exceptionally challenging. We're committed to working collaboratively in the Fifth Committee to support the adoption of the revised regular budget for this session. We're also waiting with anticipation to see the Secretary General's proposals on structured reforms and program realignment in the near future. While this Working Group is primarily focused on mandates, Cairns acknowledges the interconnected nature of the three UN 80 initiative work streams. This Working Group will need to be mindful of the other UN80 work streams as it carries out its work if we're to achieve a UN system that that is more effective and responsive now and into the future. We welcome the CO Chair's proposed approach as outlined this morning. A process which is inclusive, transparent, data driven, creative, open minded, and which reflects the varied priorities of Member States and observers will be essential. This Working Group provides an opportunity to take a more strategic approach to how mandates are created, funded, implemented and reviewed. As noted on 1 August, Cairns welcomes the proposals in the Secretary General's Mandate Implementation Review Report as important substantive input to the work of the Working Group. As we touched on the 2nd of September, we also believe the following points will be key to achieving meaningful and lasting reform through this Working Group. First, we consider how to improve mandates at the system level. We we need to learn the lessons from almost 20 years ago when a similar mandate exercise was conducted as were ultimately unsuccessful because it focused on reviewing individual mandates. The sheer number of existing mandates means a mandate by mandate approach in this Working Group is simply not feasible in the time that we have available. Second, the development and sharing of comprehensive information and analysis by the Secretariat, including but not limited to the online registry of mandates, will be crucial to help members of the Working Group understand how we might do better in drafting, implementing and evaluating mandates. Third, we encourage this Working Group to focus on how we might collectively develop practical measures to reduce duplication, eliminate redundancies, link mandate decisions with projected costs, enhance efficiencies in implementation and and terminate mandates that we agree have become obsolete. The upcoming Committee season is an opportunity to reflect on those issues and consider matters we could take forward in this Working Group. Fourth, we note that some of the recommendations in the report are within the existing authorities and remit of the Secretary General. We encourage the Secretary General to make full use of his authorities to action these recommendations as soon as possible and for this Working Group to focus on those issues that require approval or action by Member States. Finally, we echo the call for strengthened monitoring and assessment of mandate implementation. This is essential to ensure our commitments here in New York and other United nations fora translate into impact on the ground. CAANS looks forward to working constructively with our fellow Working Group members on practical steps to strengthen the the capacity of the United nations to deliver its mandates. Thank you very much.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the Permanent Representative of Australia speaking for Cairns. I will shortly invite the Permanent Representative of the Solomon Islands speaking for the Pacific Island Forum to speak, but just to let you know, this is the last speaker, at least that we understand. Speaking for a group if you are speaking for a group and you've not yet taken the floor, please do let the Secret Secretariat no Permanent Representative Solomon Islands Please go ahead.

**SLB**, Permanent Representative
Thank you very much. Court Chairs, I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the Pacific Island Forum members, in short PITH who are based in New York. We welcome the establishment of the Working Group. We stress the importance of an open, transparent and inclusive process and welcome the assurances made by the Co Chairs in this regard. We welcome the appointment of the two Co Chairs who include a PEAF member and a small island developing State member. You have our full support. We recognize the importance of all organizations, including the un, continuing to evolve and improve to better deliver for the people they serve. Indeed, the PIF members are also currently undergoing their own reform of the Pacific regional architecture. Co Chairs we know that most PIF members find the volume of the UN's work program to be highly demanding, especially given the size and the capacities of many PIF missions. PIF members are therefore cautiously optimistic about the potential benefits to be achieved by improving how mandates are created, implemented and reviewed. At the structural level, we stress the importance of ensuring that the Working Group gives appropriate attention to ensuring the UN achieves effectiveness and impact across all the three pillars of its peace and security, sustainable development and human rights. We want to highlight the importance of the UN development system for the Pacific island countries in this regard. We stress the importance of ensuring that UN remains active and engaged in the Pacific and retains an adequate and effective presence in the region through any reform efforts. Co Chairs we welcome the Co Chairs proposed approach of beginning with a discovery phase followed by the production phase, which would help ensure meaningful opportunities for participation and engagement by small delegations. Finally, we acknowledge that the question of mandates is very much one of the Member states, but welcomed the input of the Secretary General and his team in assisting members of the Working group with any data or analysis that they request. I thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of the Solomon Islands. And I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Romania.

**ROU**, Representative
Thank you very much. Co Chairs in addition to the points made by the European Union, I would like to add a few of my own. I want to offer my commiserations for this union. Important role that you are assuming, and I see this role that you're exercising is a very laborious one, but also a role that actually encompasses many work streams of our approach to the United Nations. I like very much where the journey started by the Secretary General in February this year is leading us. This process is something that we have asked for, but as Member States to be in the driving seat. We got what we have asked for. And I think here we Member States, we have to accompany your important role. We count on your leadership and we support it. It's very much important. But I think also for us, for Member States, it's a truth test. We have to look ourselves in the mirror how we can create more efficiency and effectiveness through our work. We've been going through some of the points together with Matu, our colleague from South Africa, in the revitalization process. And actually this is one of important points as we are looking towards the Committee season, which is going to be very complicated. I mean, providing many challenges that we heard from a number of delegations, small delegations, some challenges. But I think we should also be looking at the opportunities that this committee season provides. And first and foremost we have the, the path laid forward by the Secretary General on the first work stream. And then we have these several efforts underway already in this session on the harmonizing, streamlining, harmonizing and avoiding duplications that result from the recently adopted revitalization resolution. And of course we have the Secretary General Recommendation on stream 2, the report, which is very much important. I think many, many delegations, many groups talked about that. So we do see merits in opening up the Secretary General report for consultation among Member States. I want to commend your call to Member States to contribute to all these efforts, to participate at the appropriate level, senior level, ambassador level, preferably wherever this is possible. I think these discussions are very complex. The timeline is very short, it is true, but I think we can get it done at the end of the day. And what we can collectively do and not only place responsibility on the court Chairs is also for ourselves to look collectively at what could be the end result, what kind of outcome we are contemplating. This is not something that will come out of the blue. It's something that would be informed by discussions and deliberations in the past several months and also years. Understanding the overarching objective I think is very much important, especially that we are talking about the 80th session. It's an important benchmark in the history of the United nations and I think we all have a stake in it. All in all, congratulations for agreeing to take up on this role, but commiserations and I think we all should be consider ourselves equally responsible in this process.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
Thank you. I thank the distinguished representative of Romania and also thank him for keeping to the three minute timeline. We do have a long list of speakers and we are encouraging everyone to be mindful of that as well. With that, I give the floor to the distinguished representative of Switzerland.

**CHE**, Representative
Thank you Co Chair and I would like to start by joining colleagues and extending our warmest congratulations on your appointment as Co Chairs. My country looks forward to working under your wise leadership and we thank the Secretary General for his comprehensive report and also USG Rider for presenting some of the aspects today as much as the pga. And we welcome the progress made on the Mandate Registry which will provide Member States with much needed visibility across the system. My country recalls that the work of the United nations is based on three interdependent pillars, as it was just also mentioned by our colleague from the Solomon Island. This review therefore must strengthen all these pillars in a balanced manner and avoid treating them in isolation. The review must also be the subject to constructive engagement by all Member States, each of which must be prepared to make concessions so that the UN's work is sustainable, effective and in line with available resources. So our approach will be based on four principles. First, combating duplication of must be a priority. Mandates are an essential framework for UN action, but when they overlap they fragment the system and instead they should reinforce existing areas of expertise, for example in the fields of health, humanitarian action or human rights, where knowledge and capacity are already concentrated. To this end, intra and institutional competition must be avoided and the core capacities of entities must be be adequately funded. Second, build on what works the Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review. The QCPR illustrates how Member States can provide policy guidance without reopening individual mandates. The resulting reform of the United nations development System proves that clear guidance can realign the system and produce results. Similarly, functional support services should be consolidated, shared and strengthened by not dismantled. The measures envisaged must aim for long term efficiency and be based on sound cost benefit analysis. Third, mandates must be forward looking. They must be clear, coherent and adequately resourced to be credible and effective, but they must also anticipate tomorrow's challenges and benefit from technological advances and the interaction between science and diplomacy. Fourth, the responsibility of Member States Ultimately, it is up to us to ensure the coherence of the system in the General assembly as well as in the governing bodies of the specialized agencies. While fully respecting their autonomy, we must act coherently in all the bodies in which we participate. This also means that the review must go beyond the Secretariat alone and cover the entire United nations system. We have a unique opportunity to rethink and strengthen the system. Switzerland is ready to work constructively with all delegations to ensure that this review brings about concrete improvements. Switzerland is determined to continue to offer the full support of Geneva, a place of inclusiveness, innovation, digital development and scientific foresight that will increase the effectiveness of the United nations as a whole. I thank you,

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Switzerland and I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Argentina.

**ARG**, Representative
Good morning, colleagues, Distinguished Co Chairs, PGA Under Secretary Ryder in addition to the statement delivered by the Xi77 and China, the Argentine delegation expresses the following on its national capacity, the UN 80 initiative represents an opportunity to evaluate the overall functioning of the organization and seek convergences to promote more efficient and effective functioning of the United nations system while optimizing the fulfillment of the mandates. Eight years after its creation, we must remember that the organization was established with the objective of preserving international peace and security, resolving disputes among its members and defending the freedom and rights of individuals. Therefore, we must focus in the principles of the Charter and thus reassess the role of the institution recognized by society as a forum for the peaceful resolution between states. We must also make accurate and realistic diagnosis and recognized that in recent years certain agendas had been oversized, generating inefficiencies and distancing the work of the UN from its original mandates. Peace, security and development. We recognize the role of the Member States, based on their sovereign powers, in providing political guidelines to the UN system among and supervising its work, and the role of the Secretary General as a Chief Administrative officer in promoting the necessary administrative reforms. The UN 80 also represents an opportunity to have a more efficient UN system and the management of administrative and financial resources, reducing expenses and eliminating overlapping functions. In this exercise, we must assume shared responsibility between Member States and the UN system for the proliferation of certain mandates, but also for the proliferation of parallel initiatives, meetings and agendas that, without an intergovernmental mandate, lead to an oversizing and duplication of certain agendas and debates. Co Chairs we must take into account existing debates and formal spaces. For example, the recent process of revitalizing the working methods of the General Assembly. The UN 80 initiative is structural and comprehensive and we therefore await the result of the 2026 budget review and the World Stream 3 report. The review of mandates is a very important and sensitive issue and therefore must be addressed prudently and specifically without resorting the general approaches of principles. Under the one size fits all concept. Regarding the work of this other group, we consider it necessary to to have a predictable roadmap for the coming months, avoiding overlaps with the key moment of the Committee's work, especially for small and medium sized delegation and generate, as you said, quality dial IO. Additionally, and as a preliminary idea, we wish to preserve the General Rule that General assembly resolutions remain valid until they are fully implemented and not be undermined by sunset clause. Finally, the Group the Working Group could follow the methodology of the Secretary General's report organized into three stages, mandate creation, mandate execution and mandate review. The Group could focus its work on the first two stages and in this initial phase, considering the third stage requires a more comprehensive approach in time. Thank you so much.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Argentina and now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Bangladesh.

**BGD**, Representative
Thank you. Co Chair Let me begin by thanking both of you for convening this meeting. Bangladesh welcomes the Secretary General's UN Initiative Unit Initiative as a timely and necessary step forward revitalizing the UN Development system. We believe this reform process should aim at enhancing the effectiveness, efficiency and responsiveness of the event system. This is a moment to make the event more purpose driven, more inclusive and more accountable those who serve. However, the reform process must retain a clear focus on those left farthest behind the events. Development system must continue to provide solutions for protracted humanitarian and political crises around the world. Reforms must now translate into measures that cut necessary resources to the UN offices that support countries in special situations. Peacekeeping, peace building, climate resilience and sustainable development must remain our core priorities with the provision of adequate resources to fulfill mandates and to sustain effectiveness. Co Chairs, the reform process must be guided by the principles of objectivity, universality and impartiality, ensuring that priorities are based on genuine needs and not influenced by discrimination and selectivity. I thank you Co Chairs for convening this meeting.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Bangladesh and now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Paraguay.

**PRY**, Representative
Co Chairs, Madame pga, First allow me to congratulate you both, Caroline Schwarzer, Permanent Representative of New Zealand, and Brian Wallace, of course Permanent Representative of Jamaica, on your appointment as a Co Chair of this Hard Working Group, Paraguay welcomes your first meeting and extend its support to the process and to you co facilitators. We echo the sentiment expressed by the G77 in China and would like to add a few comments in our national capacity. As we have mentioned on previous occasions, Paraguay supports any initiative aimed to improving the operational efficiency of the United nations system and emphasizes its firm's position on strengthening the development pillar as a part of this effort to create a more efficient organization. We also stress the need for the establishment and work plan of the hard Working Group to be organized with sufficient flexibility, considering that the main part of the General assembly session consists with the intense workload in the Plenary and its six main committees which will allow for the effective participation of all delegation, including small ones. With regards to the organization of the work, we suggest a sequence that move from the general to specific. First clarify common objectives, then address technical or sectorial issues and finally agree on concrete recommendations. We also believe it's important to identify specific expect objectives from the outset. The roadmap that the PGA just mentioned will be crucial so that the debate does not remain purely conceptual. We consider the work carried out by the Secretariat to review the implementation of mandate to be important in this regards. The results of this analysis could be of vital assistance to our review work, for which we will require an efficient schedule that does not conflict with the task of the committees that will begin shortly, especially for small delegations like ours and many others. In this regard, we trust that the CO facilitator will be able to guide us toward the achievement of this objective with due diligence. And finally, we reiterate CO facilitators our support for the use of technology during this review process. Such artificial intelligence, given that it can accelerate the analysis of information, identify redundancies and propose synergies based on evidence, thus contributing to more informed and transparent decisions. Thank you both.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Paraguay. I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Zambia.

**ZMB**, Representative
Thank you very much, Excellencies, Co Chairs Adornset. Allow me to congratulate the both of you Co Chairs on your appointment to lead this Working Group. I'd like to assure you that of Zambia's support, Zambia aligns with the statement statements delivered by the group of 77, China, the small States Group and the Africa Group and would like to make the following remarks in our national capacity. Zambia recognizes the urgent need to streamline mandates to alleviate the unnecessary administrative burdens on the un. We should take note that the effectiveness of any reform must enhance the organization's responsiveness to their diverse priorities and pressing needs of Member States and the populations we serve. I do want to underline here that we must preserve the comparative advantage of the United nations, which makes it a very unique institution given the constraints on collective time and resources, especially during this main part of the session. The program of work to be adopted should allow for substantive discussions and consultations with Member States to ensure that all the voices of Member States are heard while taking into consideration the business schedule of committees and delegations. Further, we recognize that the mandate of this working this Ad hoc Working Group focuses on Work Stream 2 and as stated by others, it's important to review how this mandate relates to other work streams to ensure that there's no duplication with regard to the organization's work and sequence of discussion. Zambia recommends that the Adult Working Committee clearly outlines how the process the review process will be conducted, including whether a preliminary report will be shared with Member States prior to its submission to the General Assembly. Informal consultations should be designed to allow for delegation sufficient time to provide input before any zero outcome document is presented. Additionally, there must be clarity on how the Ad Hoc Working Committee will coordinate with other UN Committees as stated, especially since these bodies will continue to deliberate and issue mandates concurrently. It is essential to define how these new mandates will interact with the ongoing work of the Ad Hoc Committee. On the last point, with regard to the Working Group you know most effectively addressed the matters relating to the Secretary General's Mandate Implementation Review Report. Zambia notes that the SG's report on mandate implementation focuses on the full cycle of mandates to identify systemic challenges affecting the US UN's effectiveness and agility. In this context, it is important for the Ad Hoc Working Group to clearly define the scope of this review and specifically here we see clarity on whether the Committee will limit itself to the mandates of the General assembly or it include other mandates other resolutions such as ECOSOC and the Security Council. In conclusion, I wish to assure you of Zambia's commitment to actively and constructively participate in the discussions of the informal and Ad hoc Working Group and the Mandate Implementation Review. Thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Zambia. I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of China, Cortez.

**CHN**, Representative
All protocols are observed. China aligns itself with the statement by Iraq on behalf of the G77 and China. This unity reform offered the UN an opportunity for self renewal by enhancing its governance capacity and better adapting to the evolving circumstances. We would like to offer five suggestions. First, we must remain true to the founding mission at a Time when multilateralism and the UN are under severe strain, it is more important than ever to recall the spirit that brought nations together 80 years ago. China believes that the reform must revitalize the UN authority and vitality, safeguard the purpose and principles of the UN Charter, enable the organization to keep pace with the times and ensure that it will continue to play a central role in international affairs and make greater contributions to the for the world peace and development. Second, we must strive for real results with high efficiency. China believes that the reform should focus on improving the quality and efficiency of the UN's work, as well as its agility, responsiveness and the resilience of this organization. In this process, wasteful spending, redundant formalities and excessive bureaucracy, more must be avoided. As Member States, we are all familiar with the burden of too many meetings and too many documents, and I believe there is a broader consensus on the need for change. The Working Group may start from this aspect to deliver visible improvements at early dates. Third, we must stay action oriented. This Working Group was established by the GA to improve the creation, delivery and review of the mandates by identifying principles and follow up actions. As essential as they are, principles alone cannot be enough. They must be matched with concrete, actionable measures. Only then can the reform be truly implemented with tangible results. Therefore, we believe that when discussing relevant principles, the Working Group should also design supporting implementation measures. This will ensure that the UN makes real steps and deliver real outcomes, thereby winning the future through real achievements. Fourth, we must strengthen research and analysis. The mandates of the Secretariat comes out of the nearly 4,000 resolutions and other resources. The sheer scale and complexity make it very difficult for Member States to see all the details. We believe that the Secretariat can do more. It should build on the Secretary General's reports and recommendations, summarize past lessons and put forward practical proposals for the Working Group. At the same time, the Co Chairs should heed the views of the broader UN membership to foster cooperation, build consensus and seek solidarity through consultation so that the work of this group can stand the test of history. Fifth, we must make a balanced approach to the three pillars. The GA resolution makes it very clear that the reform should ensure effective and efficient mandate delivery across all three pillars, namely peace and security, development and human rights of the United Nations. Let me conclude by reaffirming that China will continue to work together with all Member States and the Secretariat to improve the work of the UN and steer the global governance system toward a more justable and equitable direction. Thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of China. I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of the United States.

**USA**, Representative
Thank you, Ambassador Wallace. Ambassador Schwager, congratulations on your appointment as the co chairs of the informal ad hoc working group. We look forward to working you with both of you in this capacity. In particular, over the coming months we will need to identify an ambitious set of principles and follow up actions to improve the creation, delivery and review of mandates. The United nations was established to resolve the most pressing international challenges. The mandates we provide this organization should reflect the seriousness of that purpose. They should be clear, concise, targeted and have tangible results. The ad hoc working group should result in better prioritization, greater impact and elimination of duplication across the work of the the United Nations. The Secretary General's report on the review of mandate implementation identifies numerous proposals for consideration by Member States. Shorter mandates, prioritization within mandates, flexibility to align resources, inclusion of expiration clauses, reviews of mandates, streamlining agendas and programs of work across different organs, among others. These recommendations are concrete and practical and many of them are not new. The General assembly just adopted the latest resolution on the revitalization of its work which quote, strongly encourages Member States to reduce the frequency, length and number of resolutions and to only reintroduce resolutions when operational adjustments are being made. Language that was unfortunately watered down during negotiations and it includes language, sorry. And language on the establishment of sunset clauses did not make it into the final text. We hope that in the spirit of UN80, this ad hoc working group will build on and strengthen such proposals. Our success depends on our collective willingness for reform. In parallel, we encourage the Secretary General to move quickly to implement the recommendations in his report that he can take under his own authority. And we thank Under Secretary General Guy Ryder for his remarks and information in that regard. Thank you very much.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of the United States and give the floor to the distinguished representative of Indonesia.

**IDN**, Representative
Thank you, Excellency. Let me join others to congratulate you and also the Permanent Representative of New Zealand on your assumption of duties as Co chairs of this informal adult working group. Indonesia also welcomes this first meeting of the Working Group as a chance to shape priorities and deliver progress to this task. Allow me to highlight three key priorities of our delegation. First, Indonesia stress the need to draw lessons from the past similar processes. Let's ensure that our future work must be efficient and well targeted. Second, we believe that open and inclusive approaches are fundamental to ensure broad participation from Member States, including in their national capacity or in the form of groupings. Third, we need to ensure that the process will align with other relevant parallel processes to avoid Duplication in particular this include the GA revitalization, ICOSOC reform, as well as the discussion on the reform of the Security Council. Excellency, we need outcomes that make a difference, not just more paper. In this regard, we also would like to ask a question to the how do the coaches envision the final product of this exercise? The information is crucial to help delegations calibrate their efforts and to contribute to the discussion so that we can focus on delivering tangible results. Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, we share the Co Chair's view that the task is demanding, but it's not impossible. So let's continue keeping the process open, inclusive and focused to turn limited time into meaningful progress. Indonesia stands ready to contribute to that spirit. Thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Indonesia. I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of El Salvador.

**SLV**, Permanent Representative
Gracias. Dear Co Chairs, Excellencies El Salvador and Ecuador warmly welcome the leadership of New Zealand and Jamaican Co Chair. In this process, you can count on our full support and constructive engagement. Our delegations Besides aligning to the G77 statement, we would like to highlight the following. First, BSG's recent report on the review and mandate implementation underscored China challenges that Member States know too well. The proliferation of meetings, increasingly lengthy reports, duplication of work across entities and the fragmented financing. These are not abstract concerns. They directly undermine the organization effectiveness and also the credibility. This points to an urgent need to rationalize the agenda and discussions on bienalization, tranalization or or the creation of new items cannot remain side notes to working methods debates that repeatedly are deferred to action. And in this sense, in this Working Group, we Member States must demonstrate not only the willingness but the political will to improve the functioning of organization. And that also means refraining from tabling resolutions or initiatives that add volume without impact or outcomes without action. So I take this opportunity also to make that call and that we must be serious, disciplined and ready to do our part. Even changes that may appear modest or minimum can definitely generate a transformative impact. So, Co Chairs, let me also be clear. None of this is near the other working group revitalization. Most recent resolutions provide some expectations and they give us some guidance on this. So the UNAID initiative must now build on these commitments and not reinvent them. And in that regards, we urge you Co Chairs to structure this group's work holistically, drawing, as many other colleagues have mentioned before, drawing from lessons from past processes, but also ensuring applicability across the organization's principals and subsidiary bodies. So in other words, our task is not to reinvigorate the wheel, but to make it run faster and more effectively. We also call for realism in scheduling. The heavy workload of the last quarter of the year restrains all delegation, particularly small ones as Ecuador and El Salvador. So the proliferation of processes definitely undermines inclusivity and meaningful participation. So timelines must reflect this reality. Furthermore, clarity will be needed on how upcoming mandates and agreements emerging from the main committees will feed into the UNAD process. Therefore, close coordination with committee chairs will be crucial. And finally, this initiative must be forward looking. Innovation should guide both the consultations and the proposals. And we believe the future of the UN depends not only, as I mentioned before, on political will, but also on its capacity to adapt and modernize. Nevertheless, Member States should carefully consider and study those proposals related to the potential use of new tools, including AI, to ensure that they are responsibly but also effectively used in this process. I thank you.

**ECU**, Permanent Representative
Thank you, Co Chairs. I was distracted because I was congratulated my neighbor for her excellent statement on behalf of El Salvador, Salvador and Ecuador, of course. So with this in mind, I just a few comments to add in my national capacity. But based on your opening remarks, Co Chairs, I would be remiss not to offer you from the outset the support of my delegation. This also goes to the PGA and Elena Burbuk and the Secretary as Representative Guy. Basically what I'm speaking about is helping this organization to overcome its deficiencies. Particularly because this exercise, as we have heard, coincides with a moment that is not only historic but highly challenging. Contrary to the spirit of San Francisco. The challenges of our times go to the very realm multilateralism, which is being questioned often with good reasons. Therefore, the UNAD initiative should be another instrument to strengthen the capacity to respond to today's global challenges to deliver tangible results to our peoples. I have no doubt that your proved leadership Co Chairs will succeed in contributing to have a stronger, more multilateralism led by the United nations, with sound and realistic mandates on peace and security, development and human rights. To conclude, we are ready to engage at the political level as you have asked us because particularly smaller delegations such as mine are ready to to be in the table. Thank you very much.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the Permanent representative of Ecuador. And I now give the floor to the representative of Brazil.

**BRA**, Representative
Thank you, Madam Co Chair. Dear Co Chairs, USG Rider Dear Co Chairs, I join others in congratulating you on your appointment as school FACILITATORS of this Working Group and as usual, you can count on my delegation support. My delegation aligns itself with a statement delivered by the Chair of the group of 77 in China and adds the following brief comments as we launch the activities of the working group on Workstream 2, it is of utmost importance to keep in mind that time is the scarcest resource we have. Its efficient use is critical. The constraints of initiating an ambitious task in parallel to the Main Committee's main session are not to be underestimated. We suggest dedicating these initial months to listening and reflecting before devising the shape and content of any outputs which could be left for a second moment, namely after the December progress report. Ensuring open and inclusive participation in these discussions, including those of smaller delegations, is key to ensuring a smooth Member State driven process. A very careful scheduling of activities of the Working Group is likely the most effective ways to ensure inclusivity. As many others have indicated, it is key to learn from the previous exercise of mandate review and avoid strenuous efforts that could only lead to a repetition of the limited results then achieved. The recommendations from the Secretary General's report provide valuable initial input for our work. As we begin to think ways to consider those recommendations, we suggest to focus on discussions that could enable legislative bodies to better design and review mandates that seems more effective and viable than emphasizing a backward looking approach. Mandate creation, delivery and review should not be viewed as a concentrated exercise taking place once every few years or decades. These tasks are matters that deserve continuous attention by Member States in all mandate generating bodies. I thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the representative of Brazil. I'm now going to invite the representative of France then to be followed by the Russian Federation and Algiers, France. The floor is yours,

**FRA**, Representative
Madame et Monsieur les Cote President et Monsieur le Secretaire General Adjoin. I will make some short remarks in English and French and the complete text will be made available in both languages, but first in French Je suis addresser me felicitation au de cotent du grop de travail, I recall in English, will call for a full involvement of all Member States to the process, which will be made possible especially by attention drawn on multilingualism. France, alongside its European Union partners, reaffirms its unwavering support for the ongoing transformation efforts aimed at enhancing the effectiveness, efficiency and impact on the ground of United nations action. Constructive collective. Development pay security. Concrete. We call for this Working Group to serve as a space for constructive and collective reflection with a view to achieving tangible outcomes across the three pillars of the United nations human rights development and peace and security. We must seize the opportunity for the coming months of the coming months to first, establish a sound and rigorous assessment of the current landscape with the support of a Secretariat. Particular attention should be given to a more detailed identification and documentation of overlaps and duplications in the implementation of certain mandates. Second, reach consensus and concrete proposals concerning the full life cycle of a mandate, from its creation to its implementation, ultimately its evaluation. In this regard, the proposals and recommendations contained in the Secretary General's report offer an excellent foundation for work. You can count both of you and the Secretariat on France's strong support and full engagement to help ensure the success of this essential work.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the representative of France and I now give the floor to the Russian Federation to be followed by Algeria and Thailand. Russia, the floor is yours.

**RUS**, Representative
Thank you very much. Dear Co Chairs, I also congratulate you upon your assignment and I also greet Excellency Guy Ryder who is with us. I would like to say that we welcome the Co Chairs emphasis on inclusivity. We also wish you all the best efforts to make the discussions constructive and down to business. I think this Working Group might benefit from being very pragmatic and discussing the ideas and the language that we are expected to put forward. I agree with all those speakers and support the focus on consensus basis. That should be guidance for us in our work. And as far as organization and sequence of the Working Group's work, we are suggesting step by step approach. By this we mean that we need to address least controversial issues in the report of the ESG and find the issues that everyone has no objections against and put forward them as our recommendations. And then we can move on to discuss to more sensitive areas which we have divergent views and which will take more time to elaborate our recommendations. I should also say that the Secretary General report is providing a number of recommendations both to be implemented by the Secretary General and to be considered by the General Assembly. I would like to note that the resolution of the GA which is establishing the Working Group is not differentiating the proposals, it is talking about all the proposals. Because for example, my delegation is not seeing all the recommendations as marked by SG own prerogative to be this own prerogative. I think all recommendations deserve our dialogue, our considerations. We found that a lot of recommendations put forward by the Secretary General are very constructive, very wise and very beneficial for the future of the UN. Yet we have to recognize that it is not 100% recommendations. Russian delegation is agreeing, including some of them which are marked as Secretary General Prerogative I think some of them deserve consideration by the Member States. So I think that this would also be in support of a lot of delegations who spoke to the end of the Member States driven process. We fully also support this working group and this work is Member States driven process, and we're happy to move on to suggest a timetable. We understand that you will have to juggle a lot of meetings of the main committees and we assure you of our utmost support and constructive engagement. Thank you very much.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the Russian Federation for their remarks and I now give the floor to the representative of Algeria, to be followed by Thailand and then Pakistan. Algeria, the floor is yours.

**DZA**, Representative
As a firm advocate of multilingualism, my delegation deeply regrets the absence of translation to this meeting. Excellencies Co Chairs as an opening note, allow me to congratulate you on your appointment as Co Chairs of this important process. My delegation aligns itself with a statement delivered by G77 in China and the African Group, and I would like to add a few remarks on my national capacity. Algeria attaches great importance to the UNHCG initiative, which offers a timely opportunity to strengthen the effectiveness of the United nations across its three pillars, not merely as a response to budgetary constraints, but because after eight decades, our organization must evolve into a version that is both up to date and efficient, worthy of the trust placed in it by the people of the world. This work must remain member state driven and consensus based, as the organization's legitimacy rests on its intergovernmental nature and the sovereign equality of all its members. Any review of mandates should therefore reflect the shared priorities of the membership and respect their sovereign rights equally. This process must be firmly rooted in the Charter of the United nations and in the established rules of procedure of the General Assembly. These are not mere formalities. They are the compass ensuring fairness, inclusivity and transparency. At the same time, refunds should not become an exercise in paperwork, but a means of lightening the weight that too often slows our organization and threatens the credibility of multilateralism. By reducing unnecessary burdens, we enable the United nations to channel its energy into concrete results. To succeed, we must be not only rigorous, but also creative and innovative, drawing on ideas from across the membership and not solely from SG reports. In this sense, work stream 2 on mandate implementation Review must also speak to the aspirations expressed in the two other work streams. Reform cannot be fragmented. It must instead weave together these trends in synergy. Finally, Algeria believes that the work of this ad hoc working group should proceed in phases that allow adequate time for meaningful and effective Participation by all delegations. In conclusion, Algeria reaffirms its readiness to engage constructively. I thank you,

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the representative of Algeria and I now give the floor to the representative of Thailand, our permanent representative of Thailand, to be followed by Pakistan and Lichtenstein. Thailand, the floor is yours.

**THA**, Representative
Thank you. Kochai. Congratulations to both of you on this very important appointment and thank you so much for convening this meeting. Thailand alliance itself with statements delivered by Iraq on behalf of GS Vincent China and I wish to deliver this statement from our national capacity. Mandates are the property and responsibility of Member States. It is up to us to decide when mandates should be created, which mandates are still relevant and of course which mandates have become obsolete. The Secretary General has provide a thoughtful and data driven proposals. But of course the choices and the political will lie with us. This group has only six months to deliver recommendations. Given this short time frame, you must be pragmatic and focus on what is feasible and doable from the SDA report. One useful approach perhaps could be to identify a set of quick wins, practical measures that can be agreed upon early, such as streamlining reports and resolutions or piloting sunset clauses. These measures could be of course introduced on a trial basis before deciding on more ambitious reforms. Many of the six generous proposals, digital registry, self mandates, charter and clearance resolutions, streamlined reports and meetings, expiry clauses to avoid man that's continuing indefinitely and stronger accountability for results are all practical measures that could reduce duplications, free up resources and strengthen the UN's impact. But let us also be absolutely honest. Reform will not succeed if it is directed only at the Secretariat. We, the Member States, must also change our own working methods. We are the ones who adopt more and more resolutions, who request more reports, who create overlapping mandates and who too often instruct the UN to deliver within existing resources. These habits have made the UN larger, more complex and at times less efficient. The 80th anniversary of the UN is an important chance to strengthen multilateralism and show our taxpayers that this organization can adapt, deliver and remain relevant to the challenges of today and tomorrow. To conclude, it is our responsibility to make the UN stronger and adaptable with changing times. Thailand stand ready to work with our delegations so that we can hand over a more coherent, effective and trusted UN for generations to come. Thank you very much for your kind attention.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the Permanent Representative of the Thailand. And I now give the floor to the Permanent Representative of Pakistan, to be followed by Lichtenstein and India. The floor is yours.

**PAK**, Permanent Representative
Thank you.

**PAK**, Representative
Big congrats, coaches on assuming this important Responsibility. We would also like to align with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of the group of 77 and China and and coaches. In response to your guiding questions, I would like to offer the following suggestions. One, Our delegation could be flexible with the convening of one meeting per month for the remainder of this year, which should not clash with main Committee meetings. Substantive negotiations, in our view, should commence in the next year. Two, these meetings could be thematic dialogues, each focused on one of the three aspects of the SG's report. Third, all three work streams are interlinked, particularly work streams two and three. However, we would not be in favor of considering any proposals emanating from work stream three in this Working Group unless the timeframe of the Working Group is reconsidered. We also reiterate our request for a comprehensive report on the UNAT initiative at the earliest to ensure a better understanding of the purpose of this exercise and also to ensure coherence of our action. Fourthly, the process from its outset must have transparent and inclusive modalities. Specifically, we request that all written submissions received by the co facilitators be uploaded on a dedicated website and at the same time, actions taken by the Secretary General should also be shared with Member States. Fifth, any decision or recommendation impacting existing mandates, particularly politically sensitive ones on which the concerned countries have reservations, should not be adopted until consensus is achieved and their concerns are adequately addressed. As you also noted, the clear directive of the assembly to strive for consensus on the question of how to approach the exercise. We believe that the proposed thematic dialogues must be accompanied with robust data and briefings by the Secretariat. Preliminarily, the Secretariat should provide a detailed and interactive briefing on the Mandate Registry, including an update on its status and methodology, should inform Member States about the implementation status of each mandate contained in the Registry and should undertake further work and analysis to identify actual duplications coaches. In conclusion, we believe this informal Working Group should negotiate a short resolution encouraging Member States to undertake steps that may help achieve the goals underlined in the SG's report recommendations. Our full statement is being submitted in writing. I thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Pakistan. I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Liechtenstein and following my co Chair's example, India will be next, followed by Portugal. Liechtensteinstein, you have the floor. Thank you. Thank you.

**LIE**, Representative
Co Chairs, all protocol observed. And we thank the President for her leadership in setting up this ad hoc Working Group. And we thank you for your willingness to guide us through this important and difficult process. It sounds like a very technical discussion, but at the end, of course, it is a very political one. We're talking about the future of our organization, and we want to see a process at the end of which this organization comes out leaner, stronger, and more productive and focused on all three pillars of the work of the UN Equally. I think it's important to emphasize that failure here cannot be an option. And that's the one opportunity that we have to put the organization on the foundation that it needs to be successful in the next. In the next decades. We also believe that High Level Week is very, very important for us to put this on the agenda of our principles where it has not, I think, arrived in all cases. I hope we will use the opportunities that we have and that we will also have many of our leaders actually address this in their speeches in the general debate. On your guiding questions that I find very helpful on how to. How to organize our discussions as productively and constructively as possible. We do believe early scheduling is very helpful. We also believe that what you have done for today is extremely helpful, namely give us guiding questions. And then, of course, it's up to us to take them up and to. And to respond to them. We do, of course, share the sensitivities that others have mentioned with respect to the capabilities of small states. We are one of the smallest members of the United Nations. At the same time, I do hope that all of us, and I think all of us also at the level of PRs, are committed to this process and to dedicate the time that will be necessary to make this success. I think the reality of our calendars is, is that there is almost no date that does not have a meeting of a main committee. So we would encourage you to choose dates that are taken up with more routine work in the committees where we typically are not present as PRs or not automatically. And we also encourage you to have a combination of very informal conversations outside of the setting that we find ourselves in today, but also meet here regularly so everybody is on the same page and inclusivity and transparency is fully guaranteed. So we're certainly committed, and I am committed personally to attending these meetings and to working with your guidance. On the last question, of course, and others have said that before. We have tried this before and we have not done very well. So the first lesson for us certainly is that we should do it differently than we have done it in the past and really focus on the fact that this is a mandate implementation review report that, in our view, must, you know, be focused on and be founded on having agreed parameters for beginning reviewing internal terminating of mandates and that we can apply these principles then accordingly and turn them into the action that we are all looking for and that we will actually really be needing. There are three work streams. For us it's very clear that your mandate is Work Stream 2 and for us it is also very, very clear that the success, the atmosphere and the outcomes of this process will be decisive for the success that we can have in the other work streams. I thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Liechtenstein. I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of India, to be followed by Portugal.

**IND**, Representative
Thank you. Mr. Cocchia, let me begin by congratulating you and and the Permanent Representative of New Zealand on your appointment as Co Chairs of the informal Ad Hoc Working Group India aligns with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of G7 China. Allow me to make following additional points in my national capacity. First, for the UNAT to be effective and impactful, it needs to be recognized that all three work streams are interlinked and therefore the scope of the Ad hoc Working Group should cover the entire life cycle of mandates, including creation, delivery and review across all three work streams. Second, scope of the Working Group must cover all mandates emanating from General Assembly, Security Council, ECOSOC and Human Rights Council. Third, strengthening the effectiveness and impact of the Development Plan should be accorded top priority under unat. Further, under the Development Pillar, specialized knowledge and expertise of UN entities which cater to specific context and developmental needs of countries in the Global south must be preserved. Fourth, taking into consideration the lesson learned of the past review processes, it is important that the Working Group should focus on principles rather than look into the merit of individual mandates. In addition to the inclusive trust, transparent and intergovernmental nature of negotiations under unat, the work stream too should be guided by broad principles such as reducing the periodicity of reports, mechanisms and processes incorporating sunset clause while creating and renewing mandates undertaking mandate review by utilizing AI tools with focus on the impact of mandate implementation and avoiding duplication between implementing entities. Fifth, we encourage adoption of a flexible program of work of the Working Group that allows for meaningful and widest possible participation of Member State during the main segment of the 80th session. On the way forward, Mr. Kochi, the Secretary can provide an early presentation on the lesson learned from the previous mandate review exercise and consider developing necessary AI tools to identify duplication and carry out mandate review process across the mandate landscape. The CO Chairs may wish to share their Working Work Plan take into consideration the intensive agenda of the main Committees ahead. In conclusion, Mr. Co Chair India stand ready to engage constructively and support the Co Chairs in this process. I thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of India. I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Portugal, to be followed by Mexico and then the United Kingdom.

**PRT**, Representative
I would like to start by congratulating Jamaica and New Zealand on their appointment as Co Chairs of this informal group which is fundamental for the future of our organization. Portugal aligns itself with the statement delivered by the European Union. Allow me to add some remarks in our national capacity. As we all are aware, the different layers of change motivated by the UN Initiative offer us a unique opportunity to strengthen the United Nations. The in depth analysis of the creation, delivery and review of mandates is central to this effort. For Portugal, a more coherent and predictable mandate cycle supported by clear guiding principles is essential to enhance the credibility and effectiveness of the organization. We are convinced that mandates should be crafted with stronger results, orientation, informed by evidence and aligned with the resources available. A more systematic review mechanism and a set of guiding principles would also help us identify what works, what needs adjustment and how to ensure continuity when mandates evolve or over time. In this regard, the role of the Secretariat will be critical during this process in providing the necessary expertise, analysis and lessons learned. This discussion is also linked to the challenges ahead relating to work stream one. We must be clear. Efficiency gains cannot be a substitute for adequate resources, but they can and must help us to deliver better with what we have. Portugal believes that the work streams 1 and 2 mutually reinforce efficiency in UN functioning and are a precondition for effective mandates and sound mandates are the foundation for efficiency in delivery. It is also important to address the broader budgetary context. The revised SEMAT is for the the 26 budget exercise this year with singular characteristics underscore the difficult balance between ambition and affordability. Portugal is ready to engage constructively in discussions and how to ensure that mandates are both impactful and realistically resourced so that expectations and implementation remain aligned. Mr. Cocher, Portugal stands ready to work with all delegations to ensure that this process delivers tangible improvements. More than ever, Member States should try to be flexible during the negotiation process and show solidarity with the UN principles. Let us make the UN initiative a turning point that strengths multilateralism equips the United nations to face the challenges ahead and better deliver to the people it serves. Thank you very much.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Portugal. I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Mexico and then the United Kingdom.

**MEX**, Representative
Mr. Ryder, distinguished CO Chairs from New Zealand and Jamaica, allow me to extend my congratulations on your appointment to lead the efforts of this working group. Mandates guide our collective action. Reviewing them with both prudence and boldness is an imperative. We cannot overlook. The magnitude of this challenge calls for vision and statesmanship. Mexico aspires for the mandate's review to be pragmatic, inclusive and grounded in consensus. A systemic approach is essential if we are to overcome fragmentation and strengthen the coherence of the organization's actions. Allow me to share a number of considerations that Mexico deems relevant for the process ahead, taking into consideration the three guiding questions provided this process must reinforce the UN's leadership across its three fundamental peace and security, development and human rights, while safeguarding the balance among them and consistently guided by the purposes of and principles enshrined in the Charter of the un. The mandates review should enhance coherence across the whole entire UN system, including mandates that go beyond the scope of the Secretariat for funds, programs, specialized agencies and other entities. It will be essential to promote dialogue within their respective governing bodies and to replicate this process across locations and levels of the system in order to prevent fragmentation and duplication. The review of mandates must be understood as a core element of a broader, comprehensive and ambitious reform, not as an isolated or gradual technical exercise. The goal is to transform the organization into a more effective, legitimate and results driven instrument. On the ground, the process must be guided by a clear and streamlined methodology underpinned by a forward looking vision that anticipates and avoids costly adjustments. It will be essential to design and implement targeted, systematic evaluation mechanisms that allow us to assess the relevance, validity and need of mandates, including, where appropriate, recommendations for determination in view of their fulfillment of solacence or redundancy. Adjustments to the periodicity of reviews, for instance, shifting from annual to biennial or triennial cycles, should also be considered to ensure a coherent, orderly and sustainable process over time. And the process must aim to deliver tangible, high impact results supported by efficient working methods, clear timelines and periodic evaluation mechanisms. The process must be guided by pragmatism, inclusiveness and openness, with transparency and legitimacy ensuring a collective sense of ownership and finally, an active role for the Secretariat. The Secretariat must play a proactive role by providing timely, relevant information and specialized technical support to the Working Group. This will be key to fostering a solid, well informed and effective deliberative process and to achieve concrete and implementable results. I thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Mexico. I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of the United Kingdom, to be followed by Norway.

**GBR**, Representative
The UK welcomes the appointment of the CO Chairs for this ad hoc working group and thanks them for their efforts to date and in advance for the hard work that is to come. Given the short duration for this Working Group, we need to be focused on what we want to collectively achieve and in that regard, appreciate what Ambassador Wallace noted about the importance of an inclusive and transparent approach. To that I would add the value of evidence and so welcome the fact that there will be a discovery phase at the start of this process. From a UK perspective, we think it would be helpful for this Working Group to focus on the following three areas. First, we should develop a set of principles for the preparation of future mandates. The Secretary General set out a number of these in his report, such as the Secretariat providing more information in advance of any negotiation and increased budget transparency, both of which we would support in principle. The UK would also support shorter texts with fewer meetings and reports, commissioned and more comprehensive review clauses. And we welcome and appreciate USG Rider's update on these issues as well. Second, we should develop a common framework for how we will organize our work. We need to ensure we have clear parameters for how we review the implementation of the thousands of mandates we face as we go forward. With support from the Secretariat and using the new UN Mandate Source Registry, we should categorize mandates according to which of the UN's three pillars they support, their authorizing bodies and their funding modalities, and consider these factors in how we take our work forward. Third, it is essential that the Working Group makes tangible early progress on reviewing areas of duplication and unhelpful overlap. As a starting point, we we should request the Secretariat to provide information on the wealth of reports that are provided each year. This could be a meaningful data set for the Group to review and propose rationalization. We hope that within these six months we can both agree the principles to apply to future and previous mandates, as well as agree some concrete, tangible outcomes which will support the UN AT process. We look forward to the discussions and to working alongside the co facilitators and other Member States to advance this important strand of the UNHC process. Thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of the United Kingdom. I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Norway, to be followed by Zimbabwe.

**NOR**, Representative
Thank you. Thank you so much. Co Chairs and first of all, a warm congratulations to both of you on your appointment to chair this informal group and also to shepherd this mandate implementation review process. You have our full support and confidence in the job and the duties you take on. Norway will engage actively and constructively to achieve solutions and also practical results that lead to a more effective un. Let me just quickly emphasize three main points. First, let me stress that the SG report on Mandate Implementation Review serves as a very helpful entry point for us as Member States and in the negotiation process because it expands the scope of the concept of mandate implementation by including both the design or the creation phase and also the review phase of implementation of the mandates. And most importantly, it advances a perspective on systemic improvements by focusing on some key guiding principles, uninformed options. As part of that, I'm stressing this because we will support from our side a process that is forward looking and which has a broad scope, setting a new standard for mandate creation, implementation and review and the methodology for that. Our key goal for this phase should therefore be to agree on some of these guiding principles that will have a positive and very concrete impact on the future design of mandates and the life cycles of the mandates, which collectively can help us together to address what is today the structural problem, and that's the propitiation of overlapping and duplicative mandates. My second key point, and that's briefly on your three guiding questions. I mean very many good constructive ideas have been raised in the meeting. I think from our side we just want to say that we believe it's crucial to combine two sets of key elements in this first is to ensure inclusivity throughout the process and that's first and foremost related to us as Member States. So all Member States must be enabled and able to participate full. So it has to be transparent. But it also has to involve a very significant support role, not by Guy Ryder himself, but his very well staffed team and the Secretariat throughout all the stages by providing what he also stressed is substantive support. The second element is clearly to secure, and we don't have yet any strong opinions whether it needs by nature to be sequential or whether things could be mixed throughout the process. But what is key for us is that we must be able to secure a process where both the informal part of negotiations are sufficiently that you as co chairs, sufficiently allow time for that phase. But secondly, and maybe most importantly is to ensure deep thematic, substantive discussions before going into the nitty gritty details of text based negotiations. And in that phase, clearly the role of the Secretariat must be protected and supported. Thirdly, and finally, we as Norway remain very committed to engage with all, I mean with you, but of course with all Member States both across and within regional groups. And we like both very constructively and creatively to contribute to a truly collective process that must be collective if we're going to succeed by finding an area of convergence and consensus at the end finally, for us it will be vital to find the right balance between all the three main pillars in this work and it cannot be any cherry picking and all three will count as most importantly vis a vis each other. So with those words, thank you and we're looking forward.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Norway. Give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Zimbabwe who will be followed by Trinidad and Tobago.

**ZWE**, Representative
Thank you coaches. Let me begin by congratulating you Ambassador Wallace and Ambassador Shualga on your appointment as Co Chairs of this informal ad hoc Working Group. You can be assured of Zimbabwe's full support. My delegation aligns itself with a statement that was delivered on behalf of the G77 in China and the African Group and I will share the following perspectives in my national capacity in response to the guiding questions, Zimbabwe have used this ADWOC Working Group as a critical component of the UN80 initiative which should provide an open, transparent and inclusive platform for the mandate implementation review. The ADWERK Working Group is however working within a constrained timeframe and this calls for maximum collaboration, flexibility and ultimately consensus. The report by the Secretary General outlines three areas of mandates life cycle creation, delivery and review. My delegation wishes to propose that the work of the ADWERK Working Group should consequently follow a thematic approach based on these three areas. We further propose the compilation of a roadmap of activities of the Working Group. Central to this roadmap would be an elements paper prepared by the CO chairs based on the three focus areas and the Secretary General's recommendations. Member States could be invited to submit written inputs which would be synthesized into an Outcome document with a zero draft to be ready for circulation well ahead of the report back meeting on 15 December 2025. This approach would reduce the need for multiple physical meetings during the peak of Committee work, thereby easing the burden on smaller delegations. Further, we propose that the roadmap includes a provision for three interactive dialogue sessions between January and March 2026. These sessions could be utilized as consultative sessions with the objective of finalizing the outcome document. Additionally, Zimbabwe envisages the adoption of a resolution endorsing this outcome document before the conclusion of the 80th session. We welcome the commitment by the Secretariat to support Member states in implementing WE Extreme 2 and encourage the Secretary General to regularly update Member States on the progress in the activities outlined in the Report that are within its authority and we thank Mr. Guy Ryder for that reassurance. Let us therefore utilize this opportunity to work together towards a mandate in implementation review process which culminates in an agile fit for purpose United nations capable of effectively and efficiently responding to the world's pressing challenges. I wish to assure you coaches of Zimbabwe's constructive participation during deliberations. I thank you.

thank you Chair firstly, congratulations to both of you Chair on your ascension to your respective co Chair positions. Chair Trinidad and Tobago aligns itself with the statement delivered by Belize on behalf of CARICOM and the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of the group of 77 as well as the statement delivered by Palau on behalf of oasis. Trinidad and Tobago wishes to highlight the need to commit ourselves to a process that is open, transparent and accessible by all, ensuring primacy, recency and accessibility in addition to transparency of all documents and ensure whatever we embark upon can be tracked and measured, knowing fully well, Chair that what gets measured gets done, what gets measured gets improved. Also, Chair ensure practical reconciliation and consolidation of mandates, the outcome of which can be appropriately aligned and matched to the requisite resources, if so required, to ensure that the follow up mechanism of these mandates can be optimally operationalized. Finally, Chair, I wish to remind my colleagues and all of us that this process can be at times challenging, perhaps to match the challenging times that we face requiring patience, commitment, communication, trust and transparency in the conduct of our business. I wish to reiterate Trinidad and Tobago is committed to retooling, reforming and renewing our organization and we stand ready to roll up our sleeves in this regard. We look forward to a better, stronger and smarter, more agile un. So said. Thank you Chair

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Trinidad and Tobago. Give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Uruguay who will be followed by Kuwait and then the final speaker will be Chile.

**URY**, Representative
Muches. Thank you. So co Chairs, thank you to the USG Guide writer as well. We align Uruguay aligns itself to the G77 and China statement as well as the Small States Group Declaration today. And we are also of the view of the of the need for informed decisions, evidence based decision and we also value the work on the role of the Secretariat in in providing extra additional information on for example actual duplications of mandates where we can rationalize the agenda. We need this listening mode or consultative mode at the beginning be it in thematic cluster sessions or also at a certain point the cross sectoral also view because the three pillars as we know all know are equally important and are interdependent and they all enrich the others. We we don't want the as it also was said by several colleagues, the cherry picking, forgetting some of them. It's not the opportunity to for regressions or for polarization. This is what we want to avoid at this point. If we want efficiencies and effectiveness, we need to look for synergies and the synergies of the three pillars. There are some permanent interests of the United nations like it is the human rights and fundamental freedoms which cannot simply have a sunset close. Just to put an example, probably some others very sensitive and political issues which are pending of solution cannot be subject to a sunset clause either because it signals something that there's something to be done yet. So no automatisms are needed. Yes, we need some rationalization and we heard several concrete proposals and we are going to participate in a very constructive way the impact on the ground which very much is needed. We value all of them from the guidance, the simple guidance, the sharing of best practices. Everything really is an impact on the ground. And so we need to look for those type of results. Thank you so much.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Uruguay. I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Kuwait and then Chile.

**KWT**, Permanent Representative
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Madam President, Excellencies and distinguished colleagues. I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council gcc, the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Sultan of Oman, the State of Qatar, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the the United Arab Emirates and my own country, the State of Kuwait. The GCC aligns itself with the statement delivered by the Republic of Iraq on behalf of the group of 77 in China. @ the outset of our statement we express our gratitude for convening the first meeting of the informal Ad Hoc Working group on the UN 80 initiative and the remarks of Her Excellency Annelina Baerbock, President of the General Assembly. The GCC extends its sincere congratulations to Her Excellency Ambassador Carolyn Schwalger, Permanent Representative of New Zealand and to His Excellency Ambassador Brian Wallace, Permanent Representative of Jamaica, on appointment as co facilitators for the IAHWG on the UN80 initiative. And we affirm support for their efforts in fulfilling the task ahead. Madam Chair, the GCC emphasizes the importance of focusing the efforts of the Informal Working Group on strengthening multilateralism and ensuring the full and effective participation of all Member States with adherence to the principles established in the United Nations Charter, particularly those related to preserving the effectiveness and its pivotal role of the United Nations. The Group also stresses the importance of taking into account the bustling schedule of the United nations when setting the timeline of work of the IHWG and provide ample time and sufficient means to ensure effective participation by all Member States in in its work in order to ensure its effectiveness. On this note, the GCC supports the proposal submitted by the Group of 77 in China to establish a detailed work plan for the informal Working Group. We further recommend that the subject of each meeting be clearly specified in advance to facilitate the effective management of Member States. The GCC also underscores the importance of adhering to the principles of transparency and inclusivity throughout the upcoming deliberations, with a view to ensuring a successful outcome of the mandate implementation review Under Work Stream 2 and with the overarching objective of fostering a United nations that is fit for purpose and equipped to address both present and future challenges. In conclusion, the GCC affirms its readiness to support the work of the informal Ad Hoc Working Group to ensure the delivery of its mandate. We take this opportunity to emphasize the need to approach this process with a constructive, comprehensive and pragmatic approach that takes into account the interests of all Member States without exception. Thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
Please allow me to thank the distinguished representative of Kuwait, especially for their grace and for their flexibility in accommodating the lack of translation and the miscommunication that led to that. So, thank you so much. I now give the floor to the final speaker for today's meeting, the distinguished representative of Chile. Thank you. Co Chairs, allow me to congratulate you on your appointment to this important position.

**CHL**, Representative
I wish you every success in your future deliberations. We align ourselves with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of the group of 77 and China as a contribution to the discussion on the way forward. In pursuing the objectives of this ad hoc working group, our delegation would like to offer the following suggestions. First, that our work, at least in its initial stage, remain firmly guided by the report of the Secretary General and its recommendations. This report, the result of a significant effort, should not be disregarded. Rather, it must serve as the starting point for the endeavors we will undertake in the months ahead. Second, that the work aimed at formulating a framework for future mandates be organized around the three key steps of the mandate Life cycle, creation, delivery and review. Structuring our discussions in this manner would allow for a more effective and focused process than, for example, addressing all of the Secretary General's recommendations at once. Third, that the Secretary General's recommendations on each of these key steps served as the foundation of our deliberations, asking, when needed, the support from the Secretariat to share deeper analysis and that our discussions remain centered on them while allowing space for potential new additional proposals from member states. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate our support for the co chairs and reaffirm Chile's CO commitment to engaging constructively in the work of these working groups. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Chile colleagues. Before I hand back to my co chair for some closing remarks and to close the meeting, I just wanted to say how optimistic I am that we have been able to begin this process with such a hopeful tone. I think it augurs well for the process that we embark on from here. And, and let me just take this opportunity to wish you all a successful high level week. I hope you get some rest this weekend. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Carolyn Schwalger, Co-Chair
Thank you, Ambassador Wallace. Well, I agree. I think we've had an immensely thoughtful exchange today. We know there's complexity to these issues and I think we've seen that in your interventions. But I also feel that we've had a really genuine sign of commitment by all of you to both this process, but also to the broader strengthening of the organisation. On behalf of. We're going to be informal, right? On behalf of Brian and I really like to thank all of the delegations for the constructive spirit which you have engaged in this morning. We did hear a range of people perspectives and we acknowledge that we need to think about that as we think about how we guide our collective work and how we move forward to, I guess, chart the next steps in front of us. We will remain in close contact with you. Communication will be key throughout this process and we really do hope that you will continue to participate at the highest level possible so that we can can get through the work of this group in a meaningful way that leads to a more stronger and effective and efficient United Nations. We will advise you of our next meeting of the informal ad hoc working group. The date is still to be announced, but be assured that we will be very mindful of the thinking that you have all shared with us today about the importance for a clear work process program and also one deconflicted to the extent possible with the main committees. So we will circulate a letter to you in due course. Once again, thank you to the PGA team. Thank you very much to Under Secretary General Guy Rider. Thank you very much to the Secretariat for all your support in getting us ready in a short period of time. Thank you to all the delegations who participated today. And thank you so much to the teams from Jamaica and New Zealand who've put in so much hard work to get us here in such a short amount of time. Happy high level week, everybody. The meeting is adjourned.

## Session 2: Negotiation on Mandate Framework (Sep 27, 2025)
Video: /video/k1w/k1w9g0n7gs

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I call to order the informal meeting of the Working Group for consultations on the matter of mandate creation. On behalf of Ambassador Shuolga, I warmly welcome you to these consultations. I'd like to start by recognizing the presence of Mr. Ayaka Suzuki, Director in the Executive Office of The Secretary General Mr. Christophe Monnier, Director of the Program Planning and Budget Division in the Department of Management, Strategy, Policy and compliance and Ms. Min Thu Pam, founder and CEO of Project Starling. Colleagues, as we said last week at the Briefing on Mandate creation, we are a key acutely aware of the importance of the task ahead of us. We can all agree that the UN is at a critical juncture and there is much to do to make the UN more effective, more efficient, more accountable and capable of responding to contemporary needs. Launched as part of the UN 80 initiative, our informal Ad hoc Working Group has a particular responsibility to build a set of principles and actions which can better support the creation, implementation and review of mandates. Our Working Group also has a role in building trust and mutual understanding which can support the broader goal of organizational strengthening as envisaged by the UN 80 initiative. As we have explained, this Working Group is currently engaged in a Discovery Phase where we are seeking to build our shared understanding of mandates, supported by empirical evidence, analyses and lessons learned. As Co Chairs, we want the Discovery Phase to be a safe space where Working Group members feel they can propose ideas, big and small, novel and familiar, for the way ahead. There will be ample time in the days and weeks ahead to assess the merit and viability of proposals, so we encourage Working Group members to keep an open mind about what might be possible, keeping in view the opportunity presented by this process for us to achieve the highest possible ambition. Today, Working Group members will first hear responses to questions posed at the Mandate creation briefing on 13 October. As you are aware, some answers have already been provided writing on 22nd October and should be available on the UNAT Initiative website. Further, we wish to note that in response to Working Group members questions on the Mandates Registry website, as co Chairs we have commissioned the Secretariat to provide a technical briefing on the Registry. This expert level technical briefing will take place virtually on the 28th of October at 10am and the link for that will be provided to the Working Group and the briefing will be recorded and posted on the website. Most importantly, as advised in our letter of 17 October, working group members will today have the opportunity to convey their views on mandate creation and we are very much looking forward to hearing your ideas and proposals. We also Invite you to please submit your interventions as well as any additional inputs to us in writing via our email address, which is unat mandates co chairsmail.com we intend to compile and publish on the Unity Initiative website Working Group Members contributions unless otherwise indicated by you. I'm now going to pass the floor to my Co Chair, Ambassador Schwal.

**IAHWG** | Carolyn Schwalger, Co-Chair
Good morning everybody. Now, as we turn to the questions posed to the briefers at the Mandate creation briefing on 13th October, we wish to respond to the question posed to us as Co Chairs about how lessons learned from the last mandate review and other processes have been reflected in our consideration. As Co Chairs, we have spoken with several individuals from Member States and the Secretariat who were involved in the last mandate review. We discovered three key learnings. Firstly, the previous exercise on review of existing individual mandates was a complex and time consuming process. Ultimately, the value of the technical exercise was undermined by the prevailing political realities. Secondly, it was apparent that the tools necessary to support a deeper understanding of the overall mandates for framework, such as a mandate registry, were unavailable, underdeveloped or fledgling at best. Thirdly, we learned about the importance of improving understanding between mandate creation and the budgetary process. We have attempted to build these learnings into the approach we are taking in this Working Group. Further, in response to another question, we can confirm that we have also begun engaging with Member States who have recently led relevant intergovernmental processes to see what lessons or ideas we can carry over into this Working Group. One example of this is the General assembly revitalization process. We are also engaging with the Chairs of the Main Committees to understand how the issue of mandate creation, implementation and review is being considered in their Committees and what this could mean for the Working Group's own deliberations. With that, it is now my honour to offer the floor to our briefers to provide additional answers to Questions posed at the 13 October briefing on Mandate Creation. First, I give the floor to Ms. Ayaka Suzuki, Director in the Executive Office of the Secretary General, to provide further answers to questions posed at the Briefing on Mandate Creation.

**EOSG** | Ayaka Suzuki, Director
Thank you so much, Co Chairs, for inviting the Secretariat to provide further information at this meeting. Excellency, distinguished Delegates, first, thank you so much for your strong interest and many questions after a briefing. We have tried our best to answer, provide answers in the slides that we have provided yesterday and hope to provide additional clarifications today. So, let me begin with the registry mandates.un.org There are quite many questions about the timeline, features, content development challenges and future direction. In short, mandates.un.org will keep improving if Member States find it valuable, but it would also benefit from your support and feedback. As announced just now, we will be doing a more technical briefing on this registry next Tuesday and I hope that as many of you would be able to participate so that we can introduce how to utilize it to support your work. And as mentioned by Ambassador Wallace, the briefing will be virtual and a recording will be made available available. So the timeline for completion of this registry, I mean it's an ongoing work. It already has some 4,000 mandate sources cited in the regular and peacekeeping budgets for 2026, and obviously we will be adding more as new budgets are issued and then they will be regularly updated. We will continue expanding features, categorization and functionality. The focus is on fully covering all mandate sources, especially those that are older, providing more details regarding mandates, such as operative paragraphs, entities named actions that are mandated, and then helping users see the big picture, for example, how mandates cluster across organs and topics. We already separate preambular and operative paragraphs and identify the actions, entities and deliverables in each resolution. We were able to do this otherwise very painstaking task by AI, which scans and classifies keywords across thousands of documents, and I will get into that shortly afterwards and how we use the AI. Our biggest challenge isn't so much the data, because that's all available, but in skills in coding, AI, data science and web development. To keep the registry robust and user friendly requires coding skills. And this is what UN 2.0 is about, modern digital capacity. So if you find the registry helpful, we will benefit from continued dialogue with Member States on how to sustain and improve it. The main constant will be skills, as I just mentioned, not cost. Most of the skills we need are found among young people, and that is why your support for UN rejuvenation is so critical. Finally, on scope, the mandates.un.org portal covers identify mandates coming from bodies serviced by the UN Secretariat. In other words, bodies such as the General Assembly, Security Council, ecosoc and so on. Specialized agencies are invited to develop their own registries for their mandating bodies, but using the shared data standards so that information can connect across. So let me now address a group of questions related to resourcing of registries and mandates more generally. So this was the second bigger group of questions and first on the registry development. The current version of mandates was built by a very small staff, small team in our office using skills we are promoting through the UN 2.0 initiative, I.e. with new capabilities in data design and digital delivery. Second, on the financial impact of mandates themselves. Each mandate, even a simple one, carries cost for creation, implementation and review at a minimum. That could mean staff time, translation, editing, or meetings. For such routine tasks, there are standard cost estimates that are transparently laid out in the memorandum, that is before the General Committee at the beginning of each session of the General Assembly. We refer to this document in our answers about $11,000 per day for meetings of up to two days and $25,000 for editing and translation, not the initial drafting of a report of around 8,500 words. Third, on what some of you call the cost of ambiguity. We don't really have a systematic data on the financial impact of vaguely vague language and resolutions, but we know that it matters. When the intent of a mandate is not clear, then we need extra consultations, coordination, which takes both time and resources. And that is why clarity on intent really matters. Finally, there are questions on how time intensive certain groups of mandates are in general act. As the number and complexity of mandates in a pillar grows, so do resource demands on Member states, more meetings, reports and negotiations, and on UN entities that must serve them. We can show at the registry briefing next week how to find large groups of mandates, if you like. The simple takeaway here is that resources are not only financial, there is also human and temporal the time, attention and clarity needed to make each mandate deliverable. The next large group of questions was about artificial intelligence and digital tools and how they're being used to support mandate work. First, on what AI does. It can augment research capacity. As I just explained, we use that to build up registry of mandates, for example, to help identify keywords, recurring phrases, overlaps and similarities across a large body of mandate text. It is an analytical support tool, not one to write or negotiate resolutions. That should of course remain a human process. Second, on data for mandates.un.org the system processes only publicly available documents, resolutions, decisions and budgets, all sourced from the UN Digital library. Third, on data security and quality. This site only uses open sources. No internal, confidential or personal data have been used. AI helps process large amounts of data quickly with built in checks and human reviews for quality. Some variation is normal and our team is improving the system over time. Finally, on future digital tools, we are continuing to build on your feedback over time. New digital tools, including AI capabilities, may allow for quicker comparison of text, of visual or of visual mapping of how mandates relate to each other. The goal is to make information easier to find and to understand. The simple takeaway is that AI can support analysis, not make final decisions. It can help us save time and improve visibility while we keep human judgment at the center of the process. Finally, let me speak to questions on several broader issues that were made from review clauses and flexibility in tasking to guidance for Member States and the timeline for next steps. First, on review clauses, most mandates still lack explicit review or end mechanisms. Over 80% of mandates cited in the current program budget do not specify how or when they should be reviewed. Changing that practice would make mandates easier to assess and adapt over time. We understand that the Co Chairs will hold another briefing on mandate review later this year. Second, on the Secretary General's flexibility, the report recommends allowing the Secretary General to assign tasks based on comparative advantage, meaning the entity best placed to deliver, rather than prescribing one entity in the resolution text. And in fact, that has been the norm over the years and it's only in recent years that it has become more prescriptive. So what that means is that referring only to the Secretary General, that the United nations or UN system would be the preferred or the easiest way to do assignment based on comparative advantage. Third, to better support Member States, the Secretary General proposed three main actions. Improved human support for delegates during the drafting, Enhanced Inter Secretariat cooperation to support visibility across intergovernmental bodies and digital tools. Fourth, on how to ensure new mandates are backed by resources or accompanied by a review of existing ones. Our suggestion here included using review clauses, consolidating agenda items, or proposing the discontinuation of outdated outputs, which is an authority that the Secretary General intends to make make purposeful use of. Finally, on the timeline for Secretary General General related actions, many of these actions are already in progress, including the continued improvements of mandates.un.org Fuller implementation is targeted for 2026 in line with the available capacity and resources. We will keep you updated both in a General assembly plenary and in this Working Group. The key message here is that we want to support your work on impactful mandate design, efficient delivery and accountable reviews, all grounded in evidence and dialogue.

**[Speaker Unknown]**
And with that I wish to conclude Many thanks to Co chairs,

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank Ms. Suzuki and I now give the floor to Mr. Christoph M.E. monier, Director of the Program Planning and Budget Division in the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, to provide further answers to questions posed at the briefing on mandate creation.

**DMSPC** | Christophe Monnier, Director
Thank you very much, Madam Chair. You know, adding to what my colleague just said, I'll. I'll take a few more of those questions that were posed to us. In particular, there was a few questions that related to what does the Secretariat how does Secretary determine additional resources are needed when mandates are assigned within existing resource mentioned and how is those situations treated? Just want to mention that in such situations, of course, we consult with all the relevant departments to know whether the implementation can be, you know, can be done within the existing resource, whether it can be absorbed, whether the, you know, synergies can be created with already planned activities and determining if reallocation of resources are, you know, are possible while maintaining the commitments and the deliverables that are supporting them and the delivery already. Just also want to mention that we understand and also from this dialogue that happened last week that, you know, often when there is such mention, it is also a way for the for the Member States to convey to the Secretariat that the expectation is that such a new mandate would not have a lot of additional activities or costly activities associated to it. It would not consume significant resources and therefore, you know, it would be implementing through leveraging the resources that are already available or have been planned for other activities and build synergies. There was a few questions and I'll answer on aspects of what I would call budgetary techniques that could be used to simplify or use anticipation for a more efficient budgetary process. I think that there was a mention, for example, of the concept of threshold. Whether using threshold to say, under a certain threshold, for example, there is no need to go and present pbis or above a certain threshold, there is the understanding that there wouldn't always be a PBI and there wouldn't be no absorption possible. So this is not something that we have in place, but it could be something that we can think about with criteria that makes sense so that we avoid ambiguity, a moment of the negotiation of the creation of the mandate. Also a technique that so far is only used in one area, which could be the inclusion of provision for future program budget implications at the time of preparation of the proposed program budget so that to streamline the mandate resourcing process in, you know, today we are including in the budget only things that have already been approved by Member States without anticipating possible approval. The only area where we do that is on renewal of certain mandates for human rights and we call that the consolidation. It's been in place now for a few years and it's proven to be quite a useful tool. It lowers the amount of PBIS that have to be presented in the fall. And certainly that is a tool that I think could be also an idea that could be considered on the aspect of the mandate creation process. There was, I think my colleague already mentioned, you know, how much the addition of tools, the registry of tools that help identifying what's already available not only within the Secretariat is being done, but across the UN system will be extremely useful because today we are not really in a capacity to provide that one is about the mandates. Also, global information of the funding of those mandates is not necessarily available for the UN system, but we should look into how those tools could be enriched with that information so that at the moment of mandate creation, you have access to this information, but that is not a function that is currently happening within the Secretariat and which is not really resourced neither. So that would be something to be looked into. There was also questions related to the possibility we have to understand budgetary implications or that Member States have to understand budgetary implication earlier in the drafting and negotiation process for new mandate, for example, at the stage of the zero draft, rather than waiting at the end of the process when you have more of a final resolution, and that we formally cost it. So, of course, you know, we could imagine a mechanism where throughout the negotiation there is a support of the Secretariat in terms of the costing of the drafts as they are. But again, that is one area where today that is not yet how it is being done and how it's being resourced, neither to have a dedicated team that could accompany Member States throughout the different revisions. That is an idea that is worth exploring, knowing that it would probably have a cost, but it might be worth it because then it would help creating better mandates, probably, or mandates that are calibrated to what the expectations of Member States are. So that was an idea that we also wanted to mention as possible to explore. Madam Chair, I think I will stop here, but of course available for more answers. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Carolyn Schwalger, Co-Chair
Thank you so much, Mr. Moliere. I now invite Ms. Mintuvan, co founder and Chief Executive of Project Starling, to provide further answers to questions posed at the briefing on mandate creation.

**Project Starling** | Min Thu Pham, Founder & CEO
Thank you so much, Madam Chair, and thank you all for being here and for inviting me back to brief you. It's a real privilege. I thought the engagement that we had last week was really energizing, and it was great to see so much thought from all of you in engagement in this really critical subject. I want to thank especially to those of you who asked such fantastic questions to those of us on the panel. And I'm grateful to be back here to help you think this through. As I'd mentioned, I was asked to lead the first UN mandate review 20 years ago when I worked in the office of Secretary General Kofi Annan. And it was an ambitious task and to do. So I had to form a team. And it was a team of about 20, maybe a bit more than that, that included UN staff, including retirees that we pulled back in, student interns to read through UN resolutions, manually type into a database to create the registry, and then people to also look at the, to do the analysis. And as part of that effort, I personally interviewed everyone I possibly could throughout the Secretariat, Every chief of staff, policy or planning director, head of office, anyone across the system in New York at least, who was willing, this was before zoom, who was willing to meet with me to understand how the UN really worked and how we could help make it work better. And this culminated in our own mandate registry that we created in 2005, 2006, and an intergovernmental review of all mandates older than five years. And it totaled over 9,000. That meant that some resolutions had more than one mandate. But I do want to just emphasize that part of the challenge back then was the mandate creation process itself. And maybe that is indicative of the challenge that you have here, because the World Summit outcome which gave the mandate to conduct a mandate review, I quote, and this is the World summit outcome in 2005. The mandate was, we resolved to strengthen and update the program of work of the United nations so that it, it responds to the contemporary requirements of Member States. To this end, the General assembly and other relevant organs will review all mandates older than five years, originating from resolutions of the General assembly and other organs which would be complementary to the existing periodic reviews of activities. So the original mandate for that 2006 mandate review was to review all mandates older than five years. So it was not because the Member States decided to take a different path. This was the mandate that they had given, that you all had given yourselves back then. And so what I learned from those discussions is really what I bring to this. I'm not an expert on management reform, at least not anymore. I haven't worked on it in over 10 years. Or am I versed in how the Secretariat currently manages the budgets, which you already have the Secretary of Staff here to do? But I did speak to many UN evaluation experts and many, many people, including heads of offices and chiefs of staff throughout the system. When we last met, a number of Member states asked me how this mandate implementation review can be successful where the previous one had fallen short. And I think the first one is that you are not bound by a mandate that you all had issued yourselves to review past mandates, but that you actually have the flexibility now and the opportunity to look forward, to try to figure out and really fix the mandate creation, delivering and review cycle. One of you had noted last time that we have the tools today that the team in 2005 and six were unable to offer. Chief among them, you have artificial intelligence that can ease the burdens of technical detail. You also have a much more advanced mandate resource registry that, as you've heard from Ms. Suzuki, that the Secretariat has created. As I mentioned, 20 years ago, we also had a mandate registry that was manually populated, and Member States found in those consultations that the mandates that we identified lacked and evaluative and budgetary information. And it sounds like that is still a challenge. How then can we make sure that today's mandate Registry provides you, the Member States, with the information that you need? What information does it currently provide? Right now, as you've heard, the mandate Registry allows you to search information on almost 4,000 active mandates that parts of the UN system are citing in their program budget requests. You can search by organ, body, implementing entity, title or subject matter. So, as an example, if you look at the issue of debt relief, for instance, because especially we're only four months after the fourth International Conference on Financing for Development, which I was involved in, debt relief was obviously a big issue in FFD this year if Member States were considering a new resolution on debt relief. If you look through the current mandate registry, a quick search shows you that there are 18 existing mandate source documents issued by two UN organs and cited 38 times by 15 UN entities. This is useful. Member States can use this information to inform future mandates and see what requests have already made, what you have already asked for in terms of debt relief, and then to shape what you might do in the future. However, does this information allow for a review of past or existing mandates? This is a question that a few of you asked last time. What information would you need to consider and decide on to either streamline or decide that the mandate is complete? If I were the one undertaking this exercise, I would want to know what actions were taken to implement the mandate that you issued before. I'd want to know what those actions achieved and whether it was what you had originally intended. I'd want to know what the impact was and where the effort fell short, and why, and what could be done to make it better next time. Some of this information may be hard to get, and in fact, we know that in general, impact is hard to measure, but we're still better off in trying to measure it. I would want to know this information, and lastly, I'd want to know how much it cost and Again, I'm not an expert on the UN's current budgeting and management, but in my conversations with Secretary of Staff and I think what you've just heard here is that that's not available and it doesn't appear to currently be available. And I recognize it's a huge task. So it's okay. I mean, you have a, you've done a gargantuan task in a very short period of time. But it's why I urge you to consider improving the UN's ability to evaluate its work and to provide that information back to you in a clear and coherent way so that you can make meaningful decisions on your mandates. The mandate review tools as they exist don't automatically make, I think a backwards looking mandate easier because you don't have the information to know what happened on your past mandates, the impact that it had and what then, whether it achieved the objectives and whether they can be improved. So then how can we make this process successful? What's needed currently, it would help to have improved evaluation of mandate implementation. This is something that I mentioned last time, what I've seen, even though I'm not, as I mentioned, an evaluation expert, but just talking to experts and really trying to understand this. And again, I did this many years ago, but right now it seems that the UN does not adequately finance evaluation, especially as compared to best practices. In our last meeting I suggested that perhaps 1% of the UN's budget was put towards evaluation. And again that number needs to be fact checked because the information, I base that on a cursory review, but I may not have access to the right sources. But other institutions and best practices says that we should budget about 3 to 10% of a program to adequate program evaluation. One way for Member States to address this is to carve out funding for mandates evaluation or to designate in a PBI a program budget implication a certain percentage for rigorous self and independent evaluation. The benchmarks and criteria for evaluation could also be identified in the mandate creation process. Perhaps Member States could request the Secretary to prepare and present criteria for evaluation of a mandated program and the impact as well as importantly the timeline for execution. I think you've also just heard from the Secretary that they would prefer to have that as well. And remember, and as I remember it, the budget process looks at inputs, outputs and outcomes. But I wonder, could that be applied to specific specific mandates and then done in a rigorous way so that you have the information you need? Institutionalizing improved evaluation, making that information available to Member States would be a solid step towards helping you all be better custodians of your mandates and make informed decisions on both future mandates and older ones. A final thought for me is that, you know, I've been using the term mandates, as we all have, essentially as a proxy for what the UN or the Secretariat works on. I think really that's what we mean. What does the UN do? Because mandates, at the end of the day, are political decisions. Mandates indicate you, the member states, your intentions. What you budget towards them, whether it's existing resources or not, also indicates your intentions. Someone has to turn the outcome of your political negotiations, these mandates, into programs and budgets. This is why so many mandates repute repeat language, resolution after resolution. What it basically means that I think it's an expression of the emphasis that you put on that topic and not necessarily a duplication of activities. We spent time reading through mandates 20 years ago, and we didn't reduce or eliminate many mandates because the mandates express important intentions. If we really want to review what the UN does to know if they are outdated or duplicative activities, we may wish to consider reviewing the UN's mandated programs themselves. And there I'd look to, first of all, reports. I think the Secretariat has identified that as a ripe area for your examination. These massive volumes of reports especially burden the smallest member state missions. I understand and appreciate the very good question that one distinguished representative last week raised about whether shorter mandates mean less staff time spent writing them. And as I did last time, I'll end with a quote here. Philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal said, quote, I would have written you a short letter, but I did a shorter letter, but I did not have the time. As many writers know, being clear and concise very often requires much more effort than writing something longer because it takes time to cut excess and to distill what you mean to say. If you all want clearer information, you could have better evaluation and much clearer and, I think, shorter reporting.

**IAHWG** | Carolyn Schwalger, Co-Chair
Thank you so much. Thank you so much. And thank you to all of the briefers for your willingness to return to answer the questions that were posed to you by working group members, but also for the commitment that you have shown in preparing some of that material in writing, which, of course, as Ambassador Wallace mentioned, is available on the UNAT website. I now open the floor for working group members to share your views on mandate creation. We hope to hear from you ideas and proposals to make mandate creation more efficient, effective and impactful. Delegations are asked to keep their interventions to 5 minutes for groups and 3 minutes for individual delegations. If you are speaking for a Group, please identify yourself to the Secretariat. I now have the honour to give the floor to the Permanent Representative of Iraq.

**IRQ**, Representative
Distinguished Delegates. I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the group of 77 and China, except the delegation of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Upon its request at the onset. The Group thanks the Co Chairs of the Informal Ad Hoc Group Working Group on the Review of the Mandate Implementation for sharing the tentative schedule of meetings for the next two months. Given the integrated nature of all three stages of of the mandate life cycle creation, implementation and review, the Group trusts that written inputs on these stages will be evaluated holistically in the entire life cycle to ensure a coherent and balanced approach. The Group also seeks further clarification regarding the request for input, as there is not yet a common understanding of the final outcome of the ad hoc Working Group and whether it will take the form of a resolution of recommendation, a statement or any type of outcome document. We would also appreciate clarity on the process and framework through which the suggested input will be considered. The Group reiterates the importance of accelerating the creation of a comprehensive registry of existing mandates. These registries should include detailed information on the cost of the mandate, the staff assigned to them and their nationality distribution. Such transparency will allow Member States to make better informed assessments and decisions. The Group reaffirmed that any review of mandate creation must remain firmly within the purview of the Member States. The Secretariat's operational discretion must be exercised strictly within the established intergovernmental framework. It is equally important that the process ensure full and equal participation of all Member States, including developing countries, taking into account capacity constraints and avoiding a hasty or selective approach. Clear and unambiguous mandates from intergovernmental bodies provide the most solid foundation for the Secretary's successful implementation. Mandate texts are political instruments agreed upon by Member States and this review process should not result in the erosion of the substantive content or negotiated language that embody the collective will of the Member States on the use of new technology, including artificial intelligence. The Group recognizes their potential to improve efficiency. However, such tools should be used to supplement the human dimension of intergovernmental work. The personal accountability of UN staff in supporting Member States remain essential. The use of AI tool without adequate safeguard, privacy and security guarantees and a comprehensive understanding could pose risk, including bias, monopolization, loss of no ones and and distortion of negotiated outcome. The Group reiterates that mandates must be supported by adequate and predictable resources. More clarity is required to understand the downstream implications of having the establishment of new mandate being conditions on the availability of resources, on granting The Secretary General discretionary flexibility to reassign or merger tasks. Such design features should not undermine the intergovernmental nature of United nations or weaken its operational effectiveness and credibility. The Group considered that we need to find a common understanding between Member States and the Secretariat on the scope and implications of the phrasing within existing resources. To conclude, the Group reiterates its commitment to engage constructively in this process. We emphasize that discussions on mandate creation must remain inclusive, transparent and efficient, ensuring full participation of all Member States. I thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the representative of Iraq and I now give the floor to the representative of Azerbaijan.

**AZE**, Representative
Thank you, Madam. Thank you, Madam Chair. First, we thank the Co Chairs for convening this important meeting and acknowledge the significance of the subject under discussion. However, our delegation is compelled to take the floor on a point of order concerning the statement just being delivered by the delegation of Iraq on behalf of the group of 77 and China. We wish to clarify that our objection is strictly procedural and we do so with the utmost respect for all Member States of the group of 77 and China. Without expressing any position on the substantive content. We state that this statement has not been agreed upon in accordance with established procedures within the Group. Azerbaijan has formally opposed its delivery due to the reason explained to the Group. While the delegation of Iraq began by stating that they speak, I quote, on behalf of the group of 77 and China. Accept the delegation of the Republic Azerbaijan upon its request. We must point out that this formulation doesn't reflect the reality. Our delegation emphasized that such a statement can only be made on behalf of the Group following the successful completion of the Group's internal procedures and with a consensus of all its members. I thank you, Madam Chair.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the representative of Azerbaijan and I now give the floor to the representative of the European Union, to be followed by the representative of the Solomon Islands. Go ahead.

**EU**, Representative
Distinguished Co. Chairs, Distinguished colleagues, I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the European Union and its member states. The candidate countries, Turkey and North Macedonia, Montenegro, Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Georgia, as well as Armenia, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino, align themselves with the Statement on Mandate Creation, a topic of today. We must acknowledge that effective mandates demand effective design and have full visibility across the entire mandate system, which includes what mandates already exist on the same or related topics, who and how is implementing them and with what results. Therefore, we welcome measures designed to first amplify the overall impact and sustainability of new mandates and eliminate implementation ambiguities. This should be done through the adoption of concise action oriented and outcome driven language, the implementation and impact of mandates should be measurable and system wide evaluation will be critical. Second, introduce sunset clauses with a robust mechanism for periodic review to minimize perpetual extensions and ensure mandates evolve or conclude in alignment with their objectives, as well as review clauses to ensure that regular assessment and evaluation of the relevance and efficiency of the mandates can take place. Third, accompany the creation of new mandates in the UN system with clear resource estimates, timely and transparent program budget implications from the very start. Fourth, strengthen a culture of efficiency and responsibility on mandate resourcing by exploring all options on resource allocation and then make sure that new mandates leading to new activities can be funded by the required corresponding resources and with appropriate oversight as a prerequisite for new mandate creation. Fifth, further implement comprehensive digital mandate registries, including by an open, transparent and trustworthy use of artificial intelligence to conduct a preliminary review and gain full awareness of active mandates to maximize mandate coordination, clear roles, responsibilities and impact, and eliminate duplication in the creation of new ones. We also encourage the Secretariat to identify and put forward rationalizations in terms of mandate execution among Secretariat entities every time mandates allow it Colleagues the European Union and its Member States strongly support the Secretary General's efforts to enhance mandate visibility and coordination across mandating bodies. To ensure effective implementation, the Secretary General must be able to act with appropriate flexibility. Therefore, we welcome greater secretarial support to Member States during mandate creation without establishing new bodies or structures, and encourage the Secretary General to assign tasks according to comparative advantages and resource availability across the UN system to ensure the implementation of agreed mandates. Colleagues it is US Member States that are responsible for mandate creation and we must guide their design and implementation with transparency, accountability, added value, due diligence, fiscal responsibility and a strong sense of common purpose. It is therefore important that the work under this work stream also links up with the discussions about structural reforms under Work Stream 3. We also believe that the above criteria and lessons learned from earlier processes should also inform in due course the review of existing mandates. In conclusion, we appreciate the opportunity to engage in this important discussion and welcome the Secretary General's proposals and vision under the UNAID Reform Initiative. As members of the Organization, we encourage further ambitious proposals from the Secretariat and remain committed to sustaining the momentum and ensuring continued ownership of this process. Chairs we will also submit a more detailed written version of our input. Thank you.

**SLB**, Representative
Co Chairs, Excellencies and Distinguished Colleagues.

**SLB**, Representative
I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum members based in New York, we welcome the opportunity that the UN 80 reform initiative offers to build a United nations that is more effective, efficient, accountable and capable of responding to contemporary needs. We as Member States must seize this opportunity. We want to thank the Co Chairs for an informative briefing on mandate creation on 13 October. PIF members are optimistic about the potential benefits to be achieved by improving how mandates are created at the structural level and see three key areas for improvement. First, we want to reduce duplication and inefficiencies in mandate creation. We note that most PIF members find the volume of the UN's work program to be highly demanding, especially given the size and capacities of many PIF missions. Small countries are the ones that suffer most from from a lack of discipline in the system as it takes away our attention from the most pressing issues to us, such as the 2030 Development Agenda and focusing on special needs of SIDS like sea level rise and fighting climate change. Negotiating on the same things in multiple forums is a waste of precious resources. Second, it's in everyone's interest to have a shorter, more focused resolutions with clearer and targeted mandates. To achieve this, we recognize that we need to give the Secretariat more flexibility on how they deliver on mandates we have created, whilst being clear that it's for Member States to set out what we want to achieve. We encourage the Secretariat to operate in a way that's more mindful of the limitations of small missions, for example by producing shorter and more focused reports. Third, everyone but particularly small states will benefit from some established tools for lead sponsors of resolutions that enable us to draft more efficient and effective mandates. We welcome the development and expansion of a comprehensive mandate registry which will help us avoid duplication. But we also need tools to support mandate design, particularly when it comes to things like resourcing, costing and evaluation, where the words used in the mandate really matter. Finally, we want to highlight the importance of the UN development system for the Pacific island countries, along with coordination with existing regional architecture and the need for review that supports building a system that is fit for purpose for tackling our unique and urgent challenges. We look forward to engaging collaboratively with Member States throughout this process. I thank you Co Chairs,

**BLZ**, Representative
I have the honor to deliver the statement on behalf of the 14 members of the Caribbean Community CARICOM and align our remarks with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of the group of 77 and China. We thank the co facilitators and briefers for the information session on mandate creation, which provide valuable insight into the first stage of mandate cycle. We also wish to thank the co facilitators for the helpful webpage and calendar of forthcoming sessions. Key takeaways from our recent exchange on mandate creation include that the entire mandate life cycle creation, implementation and review should be considered as one continuum. The tracking implementation is essential yet remains uneven and unsystematic and that mandate review should be standardized and evidence based, yet it is rarely conducted in practice. Two further observations are instructive as we plan the future work of this group. First, success should be measured should not be measured by the number of mandates discontinued, but by whether the system delivers mandates more effectively and with greater impact and second, we should take a forward looking approach that strengthens how mandates are created, ensuring that decisions are informed by full visibility across the UN system and that future reviews are grounded in credible evaluative data. Taking these points into account, CARICOM commends the work done on development of the Mandate Registry. We consider that an immediate and practical step would be to enhance the use and functionality of the UN Regulation Mandate Source Registry. The Registry should evolve into a genuine visibility and learning tool, one that allows Member States to see existing mandates across the system, understand overlaps and identify the opportunities for synergy. In that context, we support embedded a structured feedback mechanism to strengthen its utility to delegations. The G77's proposal on the categories of data to be maintained are particularly valuable. CARICOM notes that the Secretary General's report and Ms. Pham's briefing emphasize the importance of evidence informed policymaking. We agree and would support the initiatives that strengthen evaluation capacity across the UN system, including modest dedicated budget lines for independent and internal evaluations at the point of mandate creation. While our intelligence can assist with consolidating publicly available information and enhancing the Registry, CARICOM cautions against delegating or automating any form of critical policy analysis or assessment. Such responsibilities must remain under the authority of Member States and, where relevant, the Secretariat. With full respect for intergovernmental oversight and processes regarding Secretariat's role, we recognize that it already provides technical support to Member States as needed. We welcome the Secretary General's proposals to improve Secretariat assistance during mandate creation, especially to provide complementary information on related programmatic activities and resources, but underscore that this function must remain strictly technical and non prescriptive, upholding the intergovernmental character of of decision making. Mandate creation should occur based on a number of principles that we must come to agree on these could include demonstrable need, broad support, non duplication, transparency, inclusiveness and a genuine appreciation of the means for their implementation. CARICOM reiterates that mandates must be accompanied by adequate unpredictable resources. This is not only a matter of principle but of good governance. Ensuring that resources match expectations promotes accountability and transparency through a budgetary process and safeguards the credibility of the organization's work. In closing, CARICOM reaffirms its appreciation to the co facilitators for their leadership and reiterates our commitment to engage constructively in this process to ensure that the UN continues to serve people and planet efficient effectively and equitably.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank you, I thank the Representative of Belize and I now give the floor to the Permanent Representative of Australia, to be followed by Kuwait.

**AUS**, Representative
Thank you Chairs for creating the opportunity for an inclusive and collaborative consultation on mandate creation and the informative briefing organised last week.

**AUS**, Representative
I speak for Canada, New Zealand and my own delegation, Australia. As Member States, we are committed to the United Nations Charter and upholding the fundamental work of the United nations system. We welcome this opportunity to reflect on how Member States create mandates and the impact this has on the effectiveness of critical work of the United Nations. CANS highlights the following points to be considered as we focus on principles and actions to guide mandate creation. We need shorter, more focused resolutions with clearer and more targeted mandates. This will both increase the likelihood that mandates will be actively and effectively implemented and reduce current workloads. While we'll need to be clear in what we're asking, we see merit in providing the Secretariat with some flexibility on exactly how they deliver on these mandates to ensure they can do so in the most efficient and effective way possible. We need more support from the Secretariat to empower Member States to make more informed decisions when drafting resolutions to ensure that mandates avoid duplication and effectively complement relevant work taking place across the United nations system. We welcome tools such as the comprehensive online Mandate Registry being developed by the Secretariat that can support this, including assisting the lead sponsors of resolutions to draft better mandates. There are other tools that could be provided to support mandate design, such as those which institute more effective and efficient drafting. We need mandates with built in evaluation and review clauses and where appropriate, sunset clauses. And we need to reduce the number of resolutions introduced year after year with substantially the same content. We all have an interest in not spending precious time and resources on resolutions that have stopped having any real meaning or relevance. We must exercise discipline and restraint in making proposals that have resource implications for the United nations core budget, particularly in the current financial context if new resources are required to implement a new proposal, appropriate offsets should also be identified. All resolutions should include a dedicated section clearly addressing these budget issues. Key to this effort is the need better to link mandate decisions with projected costs and to enhance efficiencies in implementation. Member States must demonstrate maximum restraint in proposing new mandates and a sustained commitment to ensuring the limited resources are directed where they're most needed. We should also ensure synergies with existing processes related to mandates and take the opportunity to implement and advance work conducted under the General assembly revitalization process Sometimes overlaps between mandates can be helpful in supporting strong implementation, but often we experience wasteful duplication. We need to eliminate unnecessary duplication of similar mandates within and across various forums. Finally, while it's appropriate that this ad hoc Working Group focus on the principles guiding mandate creation, implementation and review, we also need to reach agreement on the actions required to apply these principles in practice. CAANS proposes the following concrete actions for Member States. First, include time bound provisions or mandate review clauses in new resolutions as appropriate appropriate. Second, take steps to reduce unnecessary PBIS or establishment of new costly mandates without identifying appropriate offsets. Third, ensure new mandates are linked to the core pillars of the United nations and advance tangible outcomes. Fourth, set and adhere to page limits for new resolutions and ensure these are targeted for maximum effect. Fifth, avoid duplication of mandates within and across forums six, promote multiannual mandates as the default for recurring resolutions and which do not substantively change from year to year and finally, review mandates that have not been active within the past 10 years. These actions could be reflected in a new template or guidance for the drafting resolutions. As we've stated previously, the primary responsibility for achieving a UN system capable of delivering on the outcomes our people expect and deserve lies with us, the Member States. We look forward to engaging further with Member States through the Working Group and working towards an effective reform process that results in a resilient and sustainable UN system able to deliver effectively on all three foundational pillars of its work and into the future. Thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the Representative of Australia and I also like to thank all of the speakers speakers to date who have stayed within the prescribed time limits. We have a very long list of speakers for today, so we very much hope that trend continues. I now give the floor to the Representative of Kuwait, to be followed by Lichtenstein and then the United States. The floor is yours. Thank you.

**KWT**, Representative
Madam Co Chair, Excellencies, Co Chairs and Distinguished Colleagues, I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the Member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Sultanate of Oman, the State of Qatar, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and my own country, the State of Kuwait. The GCC aligns itself with the statement delivered by the Republic of Iraq on behalf of the Group of 77 and China Excellencies. The GCC expresses its appreciation to Jamaica and New Zealand, the CO Chairs, for managing this informal ad hoc Working Group process, as well as to the Panelists for their insightful presentation and briefing conducted on 13th October. The GCC would also like to express its appreciation for the format taken by the Co Chairs in this process. While being considerate of the schedules, the platforms and other processes associated with the UN80 initiative, the GCC reaffirms that this Initiative is a timely and genuine opportunity to achieve a qualitative transformation in the method of work of the United nations through a careful assessment along with supervision of Member States and a high degree of transparency. It is equally important to note that the path forward should not be an exercise in just downsizing, but rather a strategy for achieving the attendant goals of the Initiative, namely strengthening multilateralism, ensuring the full and effective participation of all Member States and doing so in adherence to the principles and three pillars in the Charter Excellencies. Reiterating the GCC's appreciation to the Secretary General for his proposals outlined in the Mandate Implementation Review Report, we would like to bring to the attention of the informal Ad Hoc working group the following 1. The GCC reaffirms the criticality of ensuring that the review of mandate creation is exercised under the purview of the Member States. Any process undertaken to this end must include an intergovernmental approach. 2. It is essential for the Member States to have access to a comprehensive registry of existing mandates which includes detailed and essential information which would include, but not restricted to, costs of implementing the mandate, the number of staff assigned to service the functioning of the mandate and the distribution of nationalities for said mandate. The importance of this point should not be overshadowed. These details are essential for ensuring that the process achieves its intended goal of increasing efficiencies and streamlining processes while also maintaining a fair representation of nationalities. Above all, mandates at their point of creation and or while under the process of review, must ensure that the language of the relevant instruments are drafted in clear, unambiguous and unequivocal language. This is critical otherwise the system risks misinterpreting the will of the membership. It is equally important that mandate formulation remains relevant, disciplined and purposeful, avoiding the creation or continuation of mandates that are of limited impact, which risks diverting attention and resources from agreed priorities. In conclusion, the GCC remains committed to engaging constructively in the process. We believe that inclusivity and efficiency are essential and the GCC will not underplay the importance of the Charter's principles in approaching the work within the UN80 initiative. And thank you. I thank the representative of Kuwait.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
And I now pass the floor to the permanent representative of Lichtenstein.

**LIE**, Representative
Thank you very much. Thank you both, all protocol observed. And many thanks for your leadership in guiding us very capably through the discussion. Also thanks to the panelists for following up on the questions from the first sessions. We agree with those who have said that certainly elimination of mandates should not be the objective here and certainly should not be a measure of success. And I think that is an important lesson learned from what we have done in the past. I want to support that by way of general comment also that of course, this remains part of the UN 80 process on the whole, and we have to look at interlinkages which I do agree exists certainly with Work Stream 3. While I would also argue, not at this time, but as we proceed in the discussions on that work stream, where we are, in my view, at the very beginning, at the most basic level, I think it's for Member States in particular to build a common understanding about mandates. It's not always clear to us what a mandate looks like in practice, what wording constitutes actually a mandate and what does not, what differentiates resolutions that create mandates from those that do not, and why it matters for effective governance and resource use, and also what happens after mandates are created, how they're implemented, followed up, and what the intended outcomes are. Most importantly, the biggest missing link in our view, is the link to the, to the budget, to the budget process. So in order to do this, we need better tools, certainly from the Secretariat, to allow Member States to do this in the process of mandate creation and to help us draft shorter, more targeted resolutions with precise mandates. We do appreciate the mandate registry and to be very open. We have not made full use of it yet. So we're in the testing phase and we're certainly among those who will try to give you feedback on it, as has been requested. My delegation just told me that they looked for one of our favorite resolutions, that's the veto initiative, that that is one of the better known resolutions in this House. And they said they were not able to find it in the registry, which is a bit ironic because it has the word mandate actually in the title. And we will certainly do what we can to give you good feedback on this on mandate delivery. The SG does have flexibility on how that happens and we should encourage him to to use that in order to increase efficiency and synergies while maintaining accountability and having maybe that information. Also as part of the mandate registry, we would like to see a very serious discussion on periodicity. The practice in this building is that most resolutions are annual. We think that should probably be the exception and not the rule. And we also don't think that every resolution needs to have an SG report quickly. On costing. We think every mandate should be accompanied by a clear and transparent cost estimate tied to its implementation. The current PBI practice in our view, is unhelpful more than it is helpful because it does create the perception that a lot of resolutions do not lead to any use of resources, which is certainly inaccurate. And I agree with the definition of resource that was given given on the panel. So we should have access to up to date and traceable cost data, at least showing comparative figures from previous years. We look forward to continuing the conversation and giving you more detailed input on these points. I'm sorry that I spoke a bit longer than three minutes.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
Thank you so much. I thank the distinguished representative of Liechtenstein. And I'll give the floor to the distinguished representative of the United States, to be followed by El Salvador chairs, colleagues.

**USA**, Representative
The United nations can be an indispensable part of solving global challenges. But too often its efforts are dispersed across overlapping initiatives, redundant structures and endless reporting. If we are serious about reform the un, we must be willing to confront duplication head on. A system that does too much of the same thing in too many places cannot be truly effective anywhere. The mandate review now underway is our best chance in decades to bring clarity and discipline to how this organization works. With accurate information from the Secretariat about where functions, meetings and reports overlap, member states can make informed choices that simplify the machinery of the UN and strengthen its results. Done well, this review can reduce fragmentation, focus attention on priorities, and ultimately make the UN's work more coherent and impactful. We welcome the Secretary General's proposals as an important start, and we encourage him to go further. The UN 80 process should leave behind a leaner organization that directs resources towards outcomes, not bureaucracy. The next Secretary General's vision for reform will be an essential test of leadership, one that demonstrates a commitment to efficiency, accountability and measurable impact. A more integrated, streamlined approach, guided by results on the ground rather than the number of entities engaged, would deliver stronger support to countries and to their people. The measure of success must be progress achieved, not the proliferation of institutions, hours of meetings or pages of reports dedicated to a given issue. This is true of the development system, of the Human Rights pillar, and of the peace and security architecture. Mandates, too, must be seen through the lens of purpose. They are created to solve problems, not to live forever. When a mandate has achieved its goal, it should conclude that is not failure, it is success. And for every new mandate decided, at least 10 should be eliminated. To realize this vision, the Secretariat and Member States must work together with ambition and resolve. Reform is not an end in itself. It is a means to make the United nations credible, capable and trusted. Once again, thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of the United States. I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of El Salvador, to be followed by St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

**SLV**, Representative
Thank you. Co Chairs. My delegation aligns itself with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of the G77 and in national capacity. We would like to highlight the following points. In a context where UNAID initiative has generated uncertainty, this explanation exploratory phase must serve to lay solid foundations. It is essential to define without delay a clear roadmap, concrete expected outcomes and a shared set of principles to guide the work of the group. Whatever the outcome of this process, it must be ambitious and encompass the entire United nations systems. The review of mandates cannot be limited to the GA alone. It must promote a holistic vision of institutional efficiency. Genuine process will not depend on new procedures, but on a change of mindset among Member States. We must exercise responsibility and political discipline when presenting new initiatives, always asking ourselves what impact they will have on the organization and above all, on the people we serve. There are also immediate actions that can already be taken. The role of the PGA and the chairs of the main Committees is crucial in raising awareness of the growing burden of mandates and meetings. This challenge will not be resolved through procedural reform alone, but through coordination, coherence and obviously political will. In this regard, we consider it urgent that the work of the main committees during the 80s session include concrete measures to avoid repeating the pattern of generating countless new mandates. And as has already been noted in the report of dsg, each delegation must be aware of the budgetary impacts of its proposals and act with predictability. In this spirit, El Salvador is open to exploring the creation of a review or pre screening mechanism to anticipate the budgetary implications of draft resolutions, thereby ensuring greater transparency and coherence between substantive and also financial work. The main committees have a decisive role to play in this articulation. While the Fifth Committee prepares to consider the revised estimates for the next budget. The other committees must ensure that the content of the resolutions during the session does not generate more pbis, thereby contributing to a more disciplined and coherent management of the organization's resources. We welcome the launch of the platform mandates un.org which can become a valuable tool for transparency and efficiency provided that it remains up to date, accessible and truly user friendly, helping us to identify duplications and strengthen its coherence across our work. We also recognize the central role of the Secretariat in this context, but we urge them to refrain it from promoting or expanding mandates on its own initiative and to focus in its effort on being faithful and transparent implementation of the decisions adopted by U.S. member states. States finally, El reaffirms its conviction that the UNAID initiative must become a turning point. Dear Co Chairs, this anniversary is not merely a commemorative milestone, but a historic opportunity to demonstrate that the UN does not fear transformation, but that it has the courage to pursue it with ambition, vision and unity. Thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of El Salvador. Give the floor now to the distinguished representative of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, to be followed by Norway and then the United Kingdom. Sorry.

**VCT**, Representative
Thank you. Co chairs colleagues St Vincent and the Grenadines aligns with the statements made on behalf of the Caricom and G77 in China. The United nations was created so so that purpose would govern procedure to save succeeding generations, to uphold dignity and to make law and consent the foundation of peace. Work Stream 2 is where we test our instruments to ascertain whether our mandates still serve our founding narrative. The Secretary General's Work Stream 2 report offers us a new path forward. It reminds us that mandates are the property and responsibility of Member States States and it proposes practical solutions grounded in evidence comprehensive searchable mandate registries, improved support for drafters, shorter combined reports with usage data and a fundamental principle refraining from mandating new tasks not baked by corresponding not sorry, not backed by corresponding resources. I would like to propose three simple tests that align with the report's three stage cycle life cycle of creation, delivery and review one Charter test Does it advance Charter purposes and translate the will of the Member States into real results? The report emphasizes that mandates must strengthen all three pillars equally two Legitimacy tests Does it reflect broadest possible agreement and maintain trust in the organization? The report warns that continuing to mandate activities without resources ultimately erodes trust in the organization and 3 always ask the question, is it clear and focused enough to implement from these tests? From those tests flow, oh, sorry, three concrete actions that align with the Secretary General's proposals, our system. My computer keeps jumping. Sorry. Our one system wide mandate source registry with unique identifying identifiers linking each mandate to to its owning body, budget line and review calendar. The report calls for accelerating comprehensive registries across all mandating bodies. Build once, use everywhere shorter word limits by default, consolidation of duplicative reports and publication of download statistics so we measure what is actually read and used. Context matters. In 2024, 65% of the reports were downloaded less than 2,000 times. For new mandates, include expiry or scheduled review clauses for legacy mandates, introduce collective reviews of mandates addressing specific issues to claire deadwood and reinforce living priorities. Currently, over 85% of active mandates lack instructions on review or termination. As we streamline, we must safeguard intergovernmental control. Efficiency cannot come at the expense of legitimacy or the priorities. The public will judge us not by the number of resolutions we adopt or reports we produce, but by whether our mandates create outcomes they can feel. Thank you. I thank the distinguished representative of St. Vincent and the Grenadines and give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Norway, followed by the uk.

**NOR**, Representative
Thank you co chairs and thank you briefers for your advice this morning. I think this format is extremely useful. So looking forward to the continuation of that. You've asked us to come up with ideas and proposals on how to better create mandates. Allow me first just one observation that I think is fair and that is that over time the United nations system increasingly has evolved into one that reacts to a growing volume of sort of one way requirements from intergovernmental processes and from interagency processes. Now these requests mandates are often well intentioned, but they have often also become micro mandates. They are narrow, they give fragmented instructions that cumulatively this erodes coherence, it erodes efficiency and it erodes strategic alignment across the UN system. So overall I do believe we need a culture change in order to strengthen coherence in mandate creation and implementation. The UN system should transform itself or transition from a request based responsive model to a more focused on operational viability in which the organization acts on the basis of member State agree strategic direction rather than fragmented smaller requests. So, but to be practical, we have very good proposed solutions in the Secretary General's report on mandate design. So we fully endorse that. And now we should also look at what Member States can do when creating mandates. And despite what you said, Mintu, we do like the idea of shorter texts. Wherever it's possible, that should be a goal in itself and perhaps we could even go further could we agree on a voluntary basis for a sort of target length that would be the maximum for a resolution or a text. You could also have a sort of automatically triggered PBI if the text was too long. So that should could be useful. But more seriously, I think we need to perhaps establish a checklist that we all look at before we create mandates. Now, this is very much inspired, but what we as Norwegian civil servants have to do, anytime the Norwegian government should propose to do something, we need to make sure what the purpose and the scope of the action is. We have to confirm that there is no duplication in how, that no one else is doing what we're proposing to be done. There needs to be a clear time frame. There needs to be proof of financial sustainability and impact assessment and always also an inbuilt evaluation or review mechanism from the very creation of a mandate. So I mean to be discussed in detail, but I think we need some sort of checklist that all those that propose mandates need to go through and show to the rest of us that this is thought through to be within the Charter, to be. To have thought about that it's not duplicated by anyone else. And then thirdly, perhaps we should refrain from mandating new tasks which are not backed by corresponding resources or an explicit reduction in other mandates. So on a trial basis, could we agree that we don't request any new reports from the Secretary General for one year, only modify the scope of existing reports? It's possible we can decide this and then just finally, I think our colleague from Costa Rica mentioned at the briefing last week that we could have a test to evaluate mandates, whether they are similar. You could, for example, test to see, well, this mandate that we had agreed on in the past before we agree on a new one. Well, how many countries actually spoke in the debate on that mandate? How many times was the. The report downloaded from the UN website? We could do all things like this before we, before we request new mandates or new things for the Secretariat to do. So all this and more will come to you in writing. Thank you.

**GBR**, Representative
Thank you for your leadership of this ad hoc working group and for convening last week's briefing. The UK supports Jamaica and New Zealand's vision for the discovery phase, taking time to gather Member States views, clarify priorities and build the evidence base. And I think we've heard already today a lot of interesting ideas in this regard. As set out previously, we strongly support UN80 as a critical opportunity to refocus the organization on its three core pillars. As we consider the Secretary General's proposals, we should maintain high ambition and encourage creativity. This Working Group's central focus is to develop a common set of principles that would apply to future mandates. As long as we set the bar high. That approach will help us reduce duplication, ensure effective implementation of mandates, free up resources for priority areas, and ideally reduce the burden on Member States. Expanding and improving the Registry of existing mandates will also be important to enable a process of review and streamlining, and we welcome the update from the Secretariat on this issue. In the Inaugural Session of this Working Group, USG Rider updated us on the Secretary General's proposals on mandate implementation. Operationalizing these proposals, including how to ensure improved Secretariat support for Member States, will be key. I understand the Co Chairs are in the market for ideas and in that spirit I would propose that the Secretariat could do more to enhance the visibility of complementary work streams. This could include producing analysis to help Member States determine the utility of a mandate. For example, the Secretariat might produce a short operational note circulated to Member States at the start of a negotiation process that details existing relevant work, particularly mandates. Drawing on the Registry identifies gaps to determine additional mandated activity that might add value and highlights potential budgetary implications and possible efficiencies. Collectively, we should consider enhanced use of modern technology to drive forward efficiency, including to identify duplication and reduce the length of mandate text. This will require oversight, but early investment here will pay off for us all. We are open to further ideas, including the possibility of word limits, while noting the need to safeguard normative standards. Finally, we should acknowledge that many mandates are driven by political considerations. While the Secretariat can help promote governance coherence across the UN system, it is incumbent on us all as Member States to design mandates that prioritize utility, efficiency and impact.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
Thank you. I thank the Distinguished Representative of the United Kingdom. I give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of the Russian Federation, to be followed by Switzerland.

**RUS**, Representative
Thank you. Thank you very much. Dear Co Facilitators, the Russian Federation supports efforts aimed at enhancing transparency and coordination in the formulation of mandates and including the development of comprehensive registries and such tool can facilitate access to information and help avoid duplication. I think this is the main target of the UN 80 which is pronounced in the resolution 79, 318, but it should be provided that it remains fully under Member State supervision. I think many Member States stated it today and it should be used exclusively for informational purposes without prejudice to the right of the Member States to submit proposals for consideration. That's important qualifier. We recognize the value of drafting mandates that are consigned, action oriented, but must never come at the expense of substantive content or negotiated language. Mandate texts are political instruments, expression of political will and they cannot be simplified or reformulated through administrative or technical means. As to new technologies such as artificial intelligence that could strengthen efficiency and better support Member States during meetings or during drafting mandates, we underline that those technologies cannot alter any personal accountability of UN staff which must be fully at the disposal of Member States. Support Member States if and when requested, but cannot shift any responsibility to AI. Russia welcomes proposals to improve the presentation of financial and programmatic information accompanying new mandates as this enhances transparency in decision making. Separate identification of voluntary financed activities or planned voluntary financed activities is very important. However, we are firmly opposed to any ideas that could condition the adoption of new mandates or resource availability on resource availability or grant the Secretary General discretionary flexibility for assign or merge tasks across entities as proposed by the sg. Such measures would erode the intergovernmental nature of the organizations, which is, I think, supported by almost all speakers here today. Thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair

**CHE**, Representative
Distinguished Co Chairs Switzerland thanks you for convening this important meeting and in particular your careful calibration of the proceedings of this Working Group. Mandate creation is essential to the UN's ability to deliver. We need clear and coherent mandates that build on existing expertise and avoid unnecessary overlap. Co Chairs, allow me to make the following comments. First, Switzerland welcomes the use and development of new tools as outlined in par 23 of the report, in particular the Mandate Registry which enhances transparency and the suggestion of carefully using AI and other digital technologies. We take good note of your follow up document that was circulated in writing as well as the briefing provided this morning that indicates that the Registry can cover all mandating bodies serviced by the UN Secretariat and we welcome that session. Second, we support stronger Secretariat assistance during mandate creation. This may include systematic provision of information on potential overlaps. In addition, we see merit in shorter mandate texts and longer mandate cycles. Third, we welcome and support the recommendation made in para 29 to enable the Secretary General to reassign tasks between UN entities to ensure maximum efficiency based on comparative advantages and resources. In this context, allow me the following could this matter, which partly also touches on mandate delivery, be addressed and discussed at the ceb? Finally, new mandates must be adequately financed, as was also mentioned in para 29, an indicative price tag or Resource estimate should be introduced earlier, early in the negotiation process to provide guidance to Member States in their deliberations. Thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair

**JPN**, Representative
Madam and Mr. Co Chairs, thank you very much for giving me the floor. As this is the first time for this delegation to take the floor, I would like to express express our sincere appreciation to you both Co Chairs for taking up this important role. I would like to assure you of this delegation's full support and cooperation. Co Chairs. In the un, we have seen an increased number of mandates over the years, often created without sufficient consideration for overlap with existing mandates or their financial implications. This unchecked expansion has contributed significant duplications and budget growth which are ultimately unsustainable. There are two ways to address this. First, when establishing new mandates, we must ensure there is no duplication with existing ones. Second, we should consider budgetary implications, including setting budgetary ceiling to introduce financial discipline. In this regard, Japan would like to propose three key actions. First, it is essential that Member States be able to systematically verify whether any newly proposed mandate overlaps with existing mandates. We welcome the SCG's intention to set up registry designed in the manner that allows such verification to be conducted with a simple one click process. Second, when the resolution includes a new mandate which may incur budgetary implications, the proposing Member States should consult with the same secretariat and provide clear written information on the budgetary implications to all Members. Third, as proposed in the SDG's report, all resolutions creating new mandates should include expiry clauses requiring the mandate to be reviewed and renewed after a certain period in order to prevent unchecked and unlimited mandate expansion. The same principle should also apply to existing mandates which we will discuss further when we take up the mandate review phase. We believe that these steps will strengthen the UN's ability to deliver its mandate more effectively and sustainably. Thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Japan. I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of India, to be followed by Iran.

**IND**, Representative
Excellency, Mr. Co Chair. Let me begin by thanking the Co Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group for convening today's important meeting and sharing the calendar of forthcoming meetings. We also appreciate the Co Chairs for the briefing organized earlier this month and look forward to the upcoming briefings. We also thank all the briefers for their valuable presentations. India aligns with the statement delivered by the representative of Iraq on behalf of G770 China. Allow me to highlight five points in my national capacity. First, for comprehensive visibility of the mandate landscape, it is essential that online mandate registries provide additional information on each mandate, including reporting cycles, costing since mandate creation, implementing partner, etc. To facilitate effective and efficient action by Member States. Second, we recognize the importance of using AI tools with necessary safeguards to identify duplicative mandates and duplicative implementing architecture across mandating bodies. In this regard, information on the existing AI tools available with the circuit will be helpful. Additional features such as evaluating mandates may by their impact and effectiveness could be added later to assist Member States in designing more effective, concise and non duplicative mandates. Third, without prejudice to any mandate, it is essential that all mandates include sunset clauses for effective implementation, monitoring, transition and eventual exit. It will also facilitate plugging any systemic automaticity in the budget preparation process. Fourth, a Christmas tree approach to mandate creation dilutes both impact and accountability framework. Often it increases the length of mandate text. Additionally, it demands greater coordination across implementing entities, thus necessitating more resources. We consider a plain vanilla approach should guide mandate creation. Such approach could shorten length of the text, ensure effective implementation and produce greater impact. Fifth, since all three stages of mandate life cycle are interconnected, Member States should be allowed to submit written inputs on three stages after all briefings are completed. Such flexibility can yield holistic and practical insight to guide our work throughout the entire mandate life cycle and deliver ambitious outcomes. In conclusion, Mr. Co Chair, India reaffirms its commitment to remain constructively engaged in this process. I thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair

**IRN**, Representative
Bismillahirrahman Ar Rahim thank you, Co Chairs Excellencies. My delegation wishes to express its appreciation for organizing the briefings and for the opportunities to engage further on the issue of mandate implementation review. My delegation aligns with the statement delivered by Representative of Iraq on behalf of Group 77 and China. The task before this Ad hoc Working Group is critical and important in our endeavors towards the review of mandate implementation in our organization. Having in mind the fact that the mandates have been and are being created by Member States through various mechanisms and forums, ranging from conventions, protocols, agreements to decisions and resolutions in the UN relevant bodies and Executive Boards, we believe that mandate implementation review must focus on exploring the ways and means to enhance efficiency, effectiveness and strengthening, not redefining the UN's intergovernmental mandate create implementation in this regard. First and foremost we need to agree on the scope of our deliberations and the format of expected outcome of this Working Group. Given the integrated nature of mandate cycle, any written submission needs to be considered after completion of discussions on the entire life cycle, including creation, implementation and review of mandates. Second, any review of mandate creation must remain firmly within the purview of Member States. The process must ensure full and equal participation of all Member States. Third, while reiterate that the clear mandate that the clear mandates from intergovernmental bodies provide solid foundation for UN system and their successful implementation, we emphasized that the mandates are agreed by Member States and cannot be simplified, reformulated, merged or reinterpreted through administrative, technical or technological means. This exercise must never come at the expense of substantive content or negotiated language. In conclusion, Co Chairs, my delegation wishes to assure of all constructive engagement for fruitful deliberation and outcome of this Working Group. Thank you Co Chairs.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank you Ran. I give the floor now to Indonesia to be followed by Moldova.

**IDN**, Representative
Thank you Co Chairs. At the outset, Indonesia appreciate continued engagement by you, including by convening series of meetings and inviting relevant resource people to our meetings. The presentations help provide us with broader view of the context and linkages among different aspect of our discussion in this Working Group. So Co Chairs and distinguished delegates allow us to share our two views on the continuation of this process. First, we need to ensure coherence between the UNHE Initiative with other relevant processes. This Working Group meets at a time when all committees are actively negotiating their solutions, each with the potential to create new mandates. Yet, our core task here is to review, not to multiply mandates. Therefore, our ongoing work must be well coordinated with other parallel processes so that no new mandates are created inadvertently before this review is accomplished. In addition, we are also of the view that a consolidated timeline and work plan among work streams are critical. We take note of progress from other work streams, including Work Stream 3, which report was recently issued. While taking notes of the importance of the intergovernmental nature to adjust mandate, the suggestions in the report, if implemented, could significantly affect existing mandates. Hence, a consolidated timeline and work plan among the work streams will be crucial. To avoid overlaps. Particularly, all tracks must converge back to this Working Group, which screen serve as the intergovernmental forum for the UNHC on mandate implementation review. Second, we need to ensure that ambition should always be matched with necessary resources. As highlighted in the last briefing, conducting resource analysis from the initial stage of mandate creation would allow Member States to have better visibility. These resources entail not only financial resources but also human capital, among others. In this slide, we are of the view that an initial resource review by the initiators, through close coordination with relevant entities should accompany any draft resolution or outcome documents from Day one Co Chairs finally, rest assured of Indonesia's commitment to support you and in this regard, Indonesia will also continue our engagement in this process to ensure this review leads to a UN that is more coherent and truly fits for purpose. I thank you Co Chairs,

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the Representative of Indonesia and I now give the floor to the Permanent Representative of Moldova, to be followed by Germany.

**MDA**, Representative
Distinguished Co Chairs My delegation aligns itself to the European Union statement and wishes to add the following remarks in international capacity. Distinguished Colleagues Mandate creation lies in the head heart of the organization's effectiveness and credibility. At the same time, the growing number of complexity of mandates, as highlighted in the Secretary General's report, have created challenges of fragmentation, overlap and limited coordination which risk undermining this very effectiveness. From our perspective, this review process is an opportunity to reaffirm several guiding principles for mandate creation. First, new mandates should be firmly anchored in the Charter and aligned with the Organization's strategic objectives, responding to current realities rather than institutions inertia. Second, the mandate should build upon existing efforts, avoiding duplication and maximizing synergies across entities and pillars of United nations system. Third, fraud, mandate creation, negotiation and implementation, transparency and accountability must be ensured through clear benchmarks, timelines and reporting mechanisms. Fourth, the review of existing mandates should be institutionalized as a constructive exercise, not for reducing ambition but for ensuring effectiveness, coherence and measurable results. In reviewing the process of mandate creation, we wish to highlight three critical three key challenges that, in our view, continue to affect the organization's overall performance. First, mandates are generated across multiple UN bodies the General assembly, ecosoc, Human Rights Council, and various specialized agencies, often without sufficient coordination. This fragmentation leads to duplication, thematic overlap and inconsistent reporting, ultimately with awakening impact and straining the Secretariat's limited capacity. Second, for many smaller delegations, including my own, the process is constrained by limited visibility and transparency. Without a united and accessible registry of active mandates, it becomes difficult to track commitments and engage meaningfully in new initiatives. We therefore support the accelerated development of an integrated digital mandate registry such as mandates.unorg and stronger secretariat support to ensure equal participation of all Member States throughout the mandate cycle. Third, there remains a persistent gap between mandate creation and resource allocation. Too often mandates are approved within existing resources, leading to underfunding and inconsistent implementation. This disconnect undermines for both the credibility of decisions and the impact of UN work on the ground. Each new mandate should therefore be accompanied by transparent costing and clear program budget implications, ensuring the political ambition is matched by realistic and sustainable resources. Looking ahead, we support continued dialogue on practical measures to Strengthen the review of mandate creation process, including greater coherence among mandating bodies, enhanced coordination between the Secretariat and Member States and the use of digital tools to improve transparency and accessibility. Ultimately, effective mandate creation is not merely of a procedural exercise. It is a matter of credibility, efficiency and trust. By improving how we formulate, design and align mandates, we can ensure that every decision adopted in the organization truly responds to the evolving priorities and need of the people who we serve.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank you, I thank the representative of Moldova and I now give the floor to the representative of Germany, to be followed by Costa rica. We have 22 more speakers, so we'll leave it to you to do the mathematics. But Germany, the floor is yours.

**DEU**, Representative
Distinguished Co Chairs, Colleagues, Germany fully aligns with a statement made by the eu. We once again thank you for your leadership and and for organizing the very insightful briefing in our last session. Building on what we learned, I would like to make three proposals. First, we agree with the assessment of the SG and many delegations that one key challenge is the poor visibility and comparability across mandates and mandating bodies. Here, Member States need more guidance and support. We propose to introduce a mandatory mandate landscape briefing. The idea is as a prelude to negotiations of new mandates, there should be an obligation that the Secretariat, together with penholders facilitators, jointly informs the Membership about the overall landscape of existing mandates. We believe that a clearer understanding of potential overlaps between existing and potentially new mandates will have a refraining effect and could lead to to a future reduction of mandates. Second, in the end, we, the Member States decide how mandates look like it's on us to be more stringent, for example Avoid unnecessary cross references. We therefore propose that Member States agree to a voluntary code of conduct with the aim of limit the length of mandates. For instance, a ceiling of 1000 words per mandate could be considered. This will help to put pressure on delegations to focus on critical operative elements in mandates. It will also make the implementation of mandates easier and increase their impact. Third, on the better use of technology, we thank the Secretariat for establishing the online UN mandate source registry and for the additional information presented today. This is a very positive step towards creating a unified UN Registry. We should collectively think about tools that will make such a registry as useful as possible for all delegations. Germany also supports the idea of using an automized, possibly AI based tool to check resolution mandates text, for example on inconsistencies and duplications. The final decision, however, obviously remains with Member States. I thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the representative of Germany and I now give the floor to the representative of Costa Rica, to be followed by Iceland

**CRI**, Representative
Excellencies, Distinguished colleagues. Costa Rica thanks the Co Chairs for their leadership and inclusive approach. The work of this group is vital to improving how the United nations delivers on its mandates. Every mandate is a reflection of our political will to act together. Translating principles into concrete outcomes by examining how mandates are conceived, coordinated and implemented, we're also refining the way multilateralism works in practice. In this sense, Costa Rica has three observations. We considered that effective mandates are those that move from general aspirations to specific measurable outcomes. Informal reflections from thematic areas, including disarmament, showed that mandates created with clear objectives, well structured negotiation processes and, when possible, strong capacity building components have greater impact. A deliberate design encompassing a realistic scope and actionable targets ensures that political will is translated into meaningful results. Second, leadership and purpose are enablers of effective mandates. A successful mandate depends on leadership that can guide diverse perspectives towards a shared purpose. Skilled chairs and facilitators help shape clarity and balance in negotiations, ensuring that the resulting mandates reflect both ambition and feasibility. Third, realism in resource logistics and coordination. The phrase within existing resources or subject to the availability of resources no longer reflects the complexity of today's institutional environment. Early engagement with the Secretariat and timely access to operational and budgetary information are essential in all negotiations. System wide visibility and active coordination can prevent duplication, optimize resources and strengthen delivery. To conclude, mandates start with US Member States. They express our priorities and our commitment to fulfill the purposes and principles of the Charter. By working to better align our determination with realism, design, with leadership and purpose, with means, we can make the United nations more effective for the peoples we serve. I thank you. I thank the representative of Costa Rica. And I now give the floor to the representative of Iceland, to be followed by the representative of China.

**ISL**, Representative
Thank you, Madam Chair. And first, many thanks to Jamaica and New Zealand as Co Chairs of this process, for your strong and inclusive leadership and thanks to all the briefers that have spoken. A key element of an effective system is inclusivity and the full participation of all states. As a small state, we struggle to navigate the plethora of resolutions and processes and multiple lengthy reports. So I would like to make a few concrete proposals. Our guiding question is how can we make mandates more impactful and give them the attention they deserve? The repetition of resolutions on an annual basis carries the risk that important subjects get buried in the routine. Reducing the number of annual resolutions by reducing the frequency would give more air and attention for those resolutions we are considering, provided that we don't fill the void with new resolutions, fewer resolutions each year should mean more careful consideration of each one. How to get there? We could consider taking thematic groups of of resolutions in each Main Committee and rotating them over several years. We agree with others who have pointed to sunset clauses and review courses as a way of allowing us to assess at an appropriate point the ongoing relevance and necessity of mandates. We appreciate the work the Secretariat has put into establishing a Mandate Registry. This tool should be further developed to give Member States the best possible transparency on what mandates already exist, where overlap may occur with new mandates, and so forth. AI can be used while ensuring that it meets standards of impartiality. Finally, we could look at the idea raised at previous meeting of establishing templates for the drafting of resolutions, also referred to by many delegations here today, today, which in concert with stronger secretarial support, would help to strengthen the process of mandate review and creation.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank you, I thank the Permanent Representative of Iceland and I now give the floor to the representative of China, to be followed by the Philippines. Thank you, Co Chairs China aligns itself with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of the G77 and China at present, the three work streams of the UN80 initiative are becoming interconnected. From the overall perspective of UN80 initiative and in light of the topic today on mandate creation, China believes that it is essential to properly handle four key relationships. First, the relationship between streamlining and delivery. The goal of the Unity Initiative is not to make the UN smaller, but to make it leaner, more agile, more resilient and better able to provide high quality, efficient and direct support and services to Member States while eliminating redundancy and overlap.

**CHN**, Representative
The UN should also increase the investment in key areas based on the needs of Member States, particularly developing countries, and promote balanced progress across its three pillars. Similarly, the purpose of the mandate reform is not to reduce mandates. We should not bluntly cut mandates, tax reports or meetings simply for the sake of streamlining. What we should focus on is the results that such reform would deliver. We must conduct in depth analysis and make targeted efforts so as to maximize resources, effectiveness in effectiveness and expand the US Overall impact. Second, the relationship between Member States and the Secretariat Mandate creation is both the prerogative and responsibility of the Member States. Mandatory reform requires Member States to shoulder their primary responsibility and exercise due diligence from the outset. At the same time, the Secretariat should strengthen its support. To do that, Secretary Staff should be well versed in their respective areas and related fields and provide comprehensive assistance to Member States. It is also important for various departments and entities within the UN system to break down barriers and enhance coordination and strengthen their communication with Member States, including during the early stages of the work. While artificial intelligence can serve as a supplementary role, the Secretariat must ensure robust security safeguards, verification and oversight. The development of online mandatory registry should be pursued with due consideration of cost effectiveness. Third, the relationship between mandate creation and mandate implementation. Mandates can only have impact when effectively carried out and their implementation is directly affected by their creation. Like fasting the first button on a shirt, Member States must ensure that things are properly done from the very start of mandate creation. When creating mandates, it is imperative to focus on core issues so that the implementation efforts can be well targeted and resource not diluted during mandate creation. Providing previous implementation and available financial resources can help Member States better get the general picture and make informed decisions and thus create favorable conditions for for effective implementation of mandates. Fourth, and lastly, the relationship between reform and continuity. While the Unity Initiative should address long standing institutional challenges by fighting formalism and bureaucracy and practicing frugality, it is also crucial to maintain the stability and continuity of the UN's work and preserve the core value of UN, including multilingualism, so as to instill renewed confidence and momentum in multilateralism through concrete actions and results. Co Chairs China stands ready to work with all Member States and the Secretariat to continue our constructive role in improving the work of the UN and in advancing global governance towards a more just and equitable direction. Thank you Kyle Chair

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the Representative China and I now give the floor to the Representative of the Philippines, to be followed by Maldives.

**PHL**, Representative
Thank you Co Chairs the Philippines aligns itself with the statement of the G77 in China. We appreciate the briefing held on the 13th of October. We acknowledge the Secretary's role in increasing the visibility of the mandates landscape, including by assisting Member States in identifying potential overlaps and duplications and by developing the online Mandates Registry. Despite the existence of tools, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of mandates will ultimately depend on Member States who have the ownership of and prerogative over them. In this regard, the Philippines is pleased to share its recent experience on streamlining of mandates. At the 16 Human Rights Council session, a groundbreaking resolution was adopted to merge the mandates of the Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Slavery, including its causes and consequences, and the Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Girls, into one new Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Slavery and Trafficking in Persons. The Philippines, part of the Core Group on the Mandate on Trafficking in Persons, worked together with the Core Group on the Mandate on Contemporary Forms of slavery to unify the two mandates towards a more agile and integrated response to challenges that are distinct yet strongly linked to each other. The HRC resolution is considered as a historic first and can be viewed as an example of how with strong strong political will and commitment and shared commitment to improving efficiency and impact, Member States can come together to streamline long established mandates. Nevertheless, the Philippines underscores that mandate creation should be guided by the need to address specific challenges improving efficiency and delivering real impact, and should not be driven by cost cutting concerns alone. Any potential merger of mandates should only be undertaken after a thorough analysis of its implications for the peoples and the communities that we seek to serve. Finally, for the work of the informal ad hoc Working Group, the Philippines likewise recommends working closely with other UN organs and processes in Geneva, Vienna, Nairobi and other duty stations for possible exchange of best practices and lessons learned on strengthening officials efficiencies and impact of mandates. Thank you Co Chairs.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the representative of the Philippines and I now give the floor to the representative of Maldives to be followed by Mexico. Maldives, the floor is yours.

**MDV**, Representative
Thank you Coaches. The Maldives alliance with the statement delivered by the group of 77 and China the objective of this exercise should not be to simply reduce the number of mandates. Rather, it must be to make the UN more efficient and adept at handling mandates. We must focus on eliminating duplications, harmonizing mandates and improving the way they are implemented. To advance this goal, the Moldist proposes three practical steps to make mandate creation and follow up more effective. First, equip Member States with clearer information before new mandates are approved. Decisions on new mandates are often made without a full understanding of existing ones that may already address similar issues. The Maldives therefore proposes that the General assembly establish a light review process to assess overlaps and complementarities before adoption. This could draw on existing procedures such as the PBI review and make full use of the mandate's website. Better information will help Member States to place each other and each mandates where it can deliver the greatest value. Second, strengthen how we assess implementation. The Secretary General's reports to the General assembly usually describe actions taken but seldom evaluate their effectiveness. The moralist therefore proposes updating reporting methodologies to emphasize outcomes and outputs, giving Member States a clearer view of what has been achieved. The UN's field offices can support this by guaranteeing data and supplying information and reducing reporting burdens on governments, particularly that of the small island developing states. Third, introduce mechanism for regular review and adjustment. Mandates should evolve as circumstances change. An alternative process within the existing Secretariat structure could provide a periodic feedback from inception to completion, ensuring that each mandate remains relevant and aligned with its objective. Reforms should create a UN that is efficient in process and impactful in results. The focus must be on clarity, accountability and learning from experience. The Maldives remains committed to ensuring that the UN80 process builds on the system that works smarter, collaborates better and delivers real value to the people it serves.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank you, I thank the Permanent Representative of Maldives and I now give the floor to the Representative of Mexico, to be followed by Qatar.

**MEX**, Representative
Thank you Co Chairs and first of all, let me thank for your dedication and these efforts and also the information provided by the Briefers. A full text of our intervention will be shared with you and let me concentrate now in our proposals. Madam Couture in his Report of Mandate Implementation Review, the Secretary General makes available proposals on how to better align, deliver and assess mandates. For instance, to address the aforementioned challenges, the Secretary General proposes strengthening the Secretariat's support to Member States during the formulation of mandates to identify potential duplications among draft resolutions. Mexico welcomes this proposal. We also value the Secretariat's efforts to ensure that Member States have full insight into what already exists across the United nations system when designing new mandates. In this regard, we particularly welcome the initiative to introduce new tools that allow Member States to visualize and interrelate mandates during intergovernmental processes. We believe that a proactive and technologically enabled Secretariat role is indispensable in providing timely information, specialized expertise and strategic guidance to Member States to assess the relevance, coherence and necessity of new mandates. Now looking ahead, Mexico also believes that the success of this process will depend on the honesty and discipline of Member States. As we strongly advocated during the discussions on the revitalization of the General assembly. We must avoid introducing new resolutions that do not bring substantial changes beyond technical or factual updates. We also need to make commitment to reduce the length of mandate text to decide on biennial or triennial resolutions, and even include, whenever possible, the so called sunset clauses. Similarly, it will be rational to discontinue the practice of adopting the same resolutions both in the Committees and in the Plenary. This should include other governing bodies. Streamlining this practice will make our work less duplicative. Mexico is convinced that this process is an opportunity to assess and to optimize the mandates we have created, ensuring that remain relevant, effective and aligned with today's priorities.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank you, I thank the Representative of Mexico and I now give the floor to the Representative of Qatar, to be followed by Croatia.

**QAT**, Representative
At the outset, I'd like to thank the Co Chairs for convening this meeting, we align ourselves with the statements delivered on behalf of the group of 77 in China and on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Allow me to share a few key points in our national capacity. First, the establishment of comprehensive registries of mandates is essential to ensure full visibility across the mandate landscape and to facilitate the creation of impactful and coherent mandates. Given the fragmentation of mandating bodies, we call for accelerating the creation of these registries for all existing mandates across the UN system. Second, we support enhanced inter Secretariat cooperation to promote coherence across bodies and to avoid unproductive duplication such as parallel reporting on the same subject matter. Third, we should seek to harness the potential of artificial intelligence tools to assist Member States in the mandate drafting process. At the same time, human oversight remains indispensable to ensure that appropriate safeguards are maintained. Lastly, we recognize the difficult financial situation facing the United nations even as it is tasked with undertaking more activities within existing resources. Resources Many resolutions are increasingly long and prescriptive and lack actual resources to implement them. In this regard, we underscore the importance of establishing new mandates supported by corresponding resources. We thank you for your continued efforts and wish to assure you of Qatar's full support in your endeavors. Thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the representative of Qatar and I now give the floor to the representative of Croatia, to be followed by Algeria.

**HRV**, Representative
Co facilitators. Thank you for the opportunity to share our views on mandate creation and for organizing the informative briefing held on October 13th. My delegation aligns itself with a statement delivered by the European Union on behalf of its Member States, and I would like to add a few remarks in my national capacity. We appreciate your comprehensive approach to examining mandates across their full cycle. As today's focus is on mandate creation, I will concentrate on three key elements we consider essential for crafting mandates that are both implementable and conducive to effective delivery. First, mandates must be concise, clear, flexible, focused and adequately resourced. These qualities ensure mandates can serve as solid foundation for program planning and budgeting and ultimately for achieving meaningful impact. Ambiguity in mandates can lead to misinterpretation and hinder efficient implementation. In this context, early and robust support from the Secretariat, including the Budget Office, is crucial. Second, mandate visibility must be enhanced across the entire UN system. Centralized and accessible information is vital to prevent duplication and overlap, and we welcome the establishment of the UN Mandate Source Registry by the Secretariat and encourage its continued development and refinement. Third, mandate creation should incorporate mechanisms for evaluating impact and delivery. Mandates are not end in themselves. We must be able to Assess, based on evidence, their contribution to improving lives. And this is, after all, the the core mission of the United nations to serve the people of the world. Thank you. I thank the representative of Croatia. And I now give the floor to the representative of Algeria, to be followed by Turkey.

**DZA**, Representative
Thank you very much. Algeria aligns itself with a statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of G77 and China. And I would like to highlight the following points on my national capacity. The discussion on the UNH process and the reflections on how mandates are created and managed go to the heart of how the United nations translate political will into action. Reform, in our view, should help the organization become clearer in purpose, more transparent in process, and more accountable in delivery. We value the development of of tools that map the UN's mandates and make them more accessible. They can certainly help us see the broader picture. However, these tools must support deliberation, not replace it. No platform or algorithm can capture the nuance, intent and compromise that come from negotiation among Member states. Technology should simplify information, not oversimplify politics or replace unstaff. Mandates are not technical outputs. They are expressions of collective intent. Their wording carries meaning, imbalance that must be preserved. Efficiency in form should never come at the cost of substance, of inclusiveness. We also welcome the push for greater financial transparency. Clarity on the cost and scope of mandate strengthens trusts. Yet it remains essential that mandates drive resources, not the contrary. Political priorities must continue to guide budgetary ones. What will determine the success of unity is whether it results in better coordination, credible data and genuine ownership by all national member states. If reform delivers this, it will make the UN more agile without losing its soul.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
An organization that is modern in its tools but faithful to its intergovernmental nature. I thank you, I thank the representative of Algeria, and we thank all of you for being so concise in your interventions. We have 13 more speakers, so if we continue in this manner, we should be able to finish before the lunch break today. So I now give the floor to the representative of Turkey, to be followed by South Africa and then Ecuador. Turkey, the floor is yours.

**TUR**, Representative
Distinguished Co Chairs, colleagues, I'd like to thank the Co Chairs for initiating these important consultations. It is crucial for the UN to continue fulfilling its mandate while evolving into an effective and efficient organization to meet the challenges of today. Turkey has long been a strong advocate for the reform efforts aimed at achieving this goal. The UN 80 initiative holds significant potential to bring about meaningful improvements to the UN structure and operational modalities across the three key work streams. The interconnectivity between these work streams remains evident. Mandates reflect the UN's intergovernmental nature and the exclusive jurisdiction of Member States, as well as their differing needs and priorities within the UN's three pillars. As such, this work stream requires particular attention. The Secretary General's report on this issue provides a valuable reference for Member States in their decision making processes. The report underscores the importance of keeping mandates concise, clear, clear and focused. Moreover, the financial implications of mandate development should be carefully considered. Periodic reviews of mandates are essential. Efforts must be made to ensure complementarity, avoid duplication, and promote synergy between the General assembly and ECOSOC mandates. While we agree that attention should be given to the increased number of meetings and associated costs, we must also recognize that facilitating multilateralism and international diplomacy by bringing Member States together remains one of the UN's core functions. It is also important to seek potential savings within the UN80 process grounded in a balanced cost benefit analysis. We must approach any changes that could undermine the authority of other key decisions making bodies, such as such as the General assembly and its main committees, with caution. These bodies, after all, represent all Member States equally, while ECOSOC offers a general inclusive platform for all countries to engage in its work. In conclusion, as we address work stream two, we must strike a careful balance between the UN's urgent need for reform, the goal of increasing its effectiveness and efficiency, and the authority of Member States to formulate mandates consistent with the UN's intergovernmental nature. I thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the representative of Turkey. I now give the floor to the representative of South Africa, to be followed by Ecuador and then Republic of Korea.

**ZAF**, Representative
Thank you Coaches. My delegation aligns itself with with the group of 77 in China. Statement delivered by the distinguished representative of Iraq. South Africa would like to make the following remarks in its national capacity. Firstly, regarding mandate creation, General assembly resolution 77335 calling for the expanded use of digital repositories to strengthen institutional memory in is a key factor in assisting us to shape future mandates and avoid unproductive duplication that comes with additional costs. In this regard, the immediate implementation of this resolution should be heeded in order to facilitate an operational digital mandate registry, reduce the length of mandates, and ensure that exit clauses are firmly in place. Secondly, it is crucial that the appropriate attention is given to the development of the appropriate new technology and artificial intelligence tools to root out complementarities and duplications across UN entities at the inception stage of mandate creation. Thirdly, it is of the utmost importance to ensure that at the point of mandate design the required financial and human resources are duly allocated. These new mandates must be complemented with regular budget estimates while simultaneously rooting out prescriptive assignments. Without these early linkages, mandates immediately become obsolete and ineffective. We have an obligation to correct the oversight during our review process while taking into consideration the ever looming financial constraints of the organization. In this regard, we support the proposal to refrain from mandating new tasks that are not backed by corresponding resources. Fourthly, the Secretary General proposes improved Secretariat support for Member States that during mandate creation we would need clarity on how this proposal that focuses on human and financial resource allocation would be realistically factored into future budget projections, considering the reductions and revised estimates for the 2026 budgetary process. Finally, consideration would also have to be given to how Member State ownership of resolutions can be maintained. Drafting resolutions as a combined effort may have the positive benefit of assured commitment to implementation. Thank you, Coaches. I thank the representative of South Africa and I now give the floor to the representative of Ecuador, to be followed by the Republic of Korea and then France.

**ECU**, Representative
Thank you, Co Chairs. My delegation allies itself with the statement delivered by Iraq on on behalf of the Group 77 and China. Ecuador thanks the Co Chairs for presenting a clear schedule for the coming months. A transparent and predictable process is key for all delegations, especially for smaller emissions. Managing multiple Reform Tracks Ecuador agrees that this process should not be about reducing the United nations ambitions or scope, but about ensuring that what we decide can truly be delivered. Moderation supports the Secretary General's recommendations aimed at enhancing visibility, coherence and accountability across the full cycle of mandates, while ensuring that these reforms remain guided by the intergovernmental oversight and the inclusive participation of all Member states. Mandates are the backbone of multilateral cooperation and often reflect a very delicate balance to the position of Member states. Yet the proliferation of resolutions, the growing prescriptiveness of their text, coupled with the tendency to add tasks within existing resources, may have created structural inefficiencies. New mandates must therefore be realistic, adequately funded and designed with clarity and feasibility at their core. At the same time, we should remember that mandates reflect the interests of Member States and as such cannot follow a one size fits all approach. Rather, it should be assessed on its own merits. Ecuador also welcomes the Secretary General's initiative to establish the UN Mandate Registry as a tangible step toward transparency. Looking ahead, Ecuador considers important the following discussions take into account the interconnection among the three UN 80 work streams and that we approach them with a balance between ambition and a good sense of realism. To conclude, my delegation looks forward to further clarity regarding the expected outcome of this process and the framework through which Member States contributions will be considered. Thank you very much.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the representative of Ecuador. I give the floor now to the representative of the Republic of Korea, to be followed by France. Thank you Co Chairs for this consultation and also we briefers for their clarification. Today, my delegation would like to suggest the following considerations. First, regarding mandate registry, as Director Suzuki explained today, we would like to encourage the Secretariat to develop more analytical functionality that extend beyond merely compiling text, thus enabling Member States to have a better informed decisions.

**KOR**, Representative
Second, the mandate registries alone cannot reveal the whole picture. We should explore mechanism for early engagement with the Secretariat during the design phase, similar to legislative consultation practices in many domestic settings. To facilitate such engagement, we would welcome consideration of streamlined coordination arrangement or one stop channel within the Secretariat, potentially resulting in information or analytical notes to check duplication, to ensure coherence and to verify resource availability, including the additional information indicated by Director Monia today. Third, the persistent mismatch between mandates and available resources. This challenge cannot be entirely resolved resolved when mandates are created. Nevertheless, we should develop procedures facilitating resources, reallocation from existing programs toward new mandates where possible and drawing from result based budgeting methodology that are already in place. We should address this structural impediment more systematically. Fourth, we advocate incorporating review of sunset closes in new resolutions. Newly created mandates should face a periodic assessment. Fifth, regarding implementation flexibility, we should develop guidance through dialogue with the Secretariat to give Secretary General appropriate discretion and authority to optimize delivery arrangement. Finally, on lengthier resolutions, we should submit set explicit standards or ceiling on drafting practices that foster conciseness and actionability. Colleagues, mandate creation is a Member State prerogative. Yet it is also our shared duty duty to design mandates that can deliver. So we should remind ourselves this exercise demands bolder steps and greater self discipline on our part. From the design phase, I thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the Representative of the Republic of Korea. Give the floor now to France, to be followed by Argentina and then paraguay.

**FRA**, Representative
Many thanks, Mr. President. I would like first to thank also Mrs. Suzuki, Mrs. Pham and Mr. Mounier for their remarks and complimentary to the Statement of the eu. I would like to make four remarks and address two requests. First, we fully support the idea of systematic introduction of sunset and review closes of mandates to make sure that in a few years from now, what we have asked the UN to do continues to be relevant and could be fine tuned or updated. Second, we fully support the principle to give more flexibility to the Secretariat to implement mandates, decide on which department, agency or fundamental is responsible for an activity based on the comparative advantage of each? This is linked to our strong support of the role of the Secretary General as Chief Administrative Coordinator of the whole UN system. However, this new responsibility should come with the understanding that the number of Secretariat entities or agencies tasked with one given mandate is systematic, systematically limited to the required minimum. Third, we fully support measures to build awareness of Member States on existing mandates. The UN Mandates Registry, complemented by artificial intelligence, may provide a strong basis to this end. Secretariat guidance before the negotiation process and during mandate elaboration will also be key in this regard, as proposed, for example, by the eu, Germany or UK previously. Fourth, yes, of course we need to be able to fund correctly new mandates fully and yet we believe that systematic introduction of resource requirements, be it financial or in human resources, may also contribute to the piling up of budgetary resources. Therefore, resource demands to Member States need to come up only after an internal, careful and thorough review has been done internally, based on clear criteria, to see if the new mandate cannot be absorbed within existing resources with new relocation of work or priorisation of resources. We need to avoid the practice of small PBIs, for instance, as this contributes to budgetary fragmentation increase. I am sure we can work toward a new way of functioning in line with the requests already made by the Fifth Committee to the Secretariat to intensify its efforts towards zero based budgeting. We'll propose this in writing, but we would be interested in receiving communication from the Secretariat on two points. First, the list of reports and recommendations on which ones could be given up or merged with others. Second, more details about the heating map showing duplications to identify the areas where we need to work most. Enfin affin de conclude travail de plus. Initiative Au nu quatrovin.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
Thank you. I thank the representative of France. I give the floor now to Argentina, to be followed by Paraguay.

**ARG**, Representative
Mucha heracia Presidente. I will also switch to English, but firstly allow me to thank for the responses that we received from all the very good questions that were raised in the previous meeting. We appreciate the effort to have the response in written and today. Regarding the discussions today, allow me to make some remarks based on the Secretary General report on the issue of poor visibility across existing mandates. We have some comments. First, we believe that there is a need to have collective responsibility or collective accountability. This has to be promoted in order to identify overlaps, prior mandates or overlapping in the impacts of existing work. We do believe there is a primary political responsibility among proponents of resolutions or also co FACILITATORS of negotiating process on this issue. There has to be of course an active and neutral technical support from the Secretariat to identify these overlappings. Also IT tools I would say and this Secretary of support is important but these do not accept exempt our collective responsibility and the primary responsibility from proponents when new mandates are created. We also do believe that the Secretariat should or could play a more neutral role on some issues. We all know that some mandates tend to be Secretariat driven or Secretariat influence. That's something that we need to address at some point and also we need to better integrate not only mandates from New York based bodies, but also what's happening in other UN headquarters, Geneva, Vienna, Nairobi and other agencies. Sometimes we are discussing here things that have been already addressed in ILO who or other issues. And also we would like to recall what we said at the beginning on this general rule that UNGA resolutions remain valid until they are fully implemented. So this is a very important element that cannot be under my band sunset clauses. So what we are saying here is that the there is no one size fits all when we address these issues. Regarding challenges in demanded design, the SG report propose specific ideas that we welcome. I think it's necessary to reduce the length of texts and mandates and make them more focused, effective and action oriented. Again, this has to be a collective understanding and a collective agreement. And at some point we will have to link this collective understanding and agreement or what we are saying here, what's actually or currently happening in the basement. If you go to 1B the discussions are going in a very different way of some interventions or things that we say here. But also while this is a collective responsibility, we do believe that there could be an active and joint leadership from those who decide member states or individual who decides to assume positions on committee bureaus, executive boards and governing bodies of the UN system as well from presidencies, from unga, ECOSOC and designated co facilitators in negotiating process. We thank for the response. Also on the PBI implications in advance for us, I think it's important to have some consideration of PBI implications in initial stage of negotiations and not at the end. So having this report ex ante will be useful for negotiations at some point. We do believe that maybe we will need to have a common understanding on the scope of implications of the phrase within existing resources. The Secretary has an explanation in negotiations sometimes that is used as a political way out to okay, you have the mandate, but only if you get the money. That doesn't mean new budgetary implications. So I believe that we might have to have an understanding of that, and we do believe that some budget allocations or funding at some point will have to be tied to verifiable and concrete results on the ground. Thank you, Chair.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
Thank you. Thanks to Argentina. I give the floor now to Paraguay, to be followed by Cuba.

**PRY**, Representative
Thank you, Chair. My delegation wishes to express a few considerations in addition to the statement delivered by the group of 77 in China and first makes a strong call not to miss the current opportunity that arises from the UN 80 initiative. In this regard, it supports the effort of this working Group and appreciates the roadmap that has been outlayed outlined when referring specifically to the creation of mandates, my delegation took note of two challenges highlighted in the Secretary General's report the limited visibility of the overall landscape of existing mandates and of the work carried out by the various bodies that established them, and the difficulties in mandate design that can restrict their impact during implementation. PARAGUIDE recognizes that a clear vision of the full set of mandates is essential to maximize their impact. In this sense, it supports initiatives aimed at improving their visibility, such as the digital registries under the UN 80 initiative, which help Member States avoid unnecessary duplications. It also underscores the importance of strengthening the duplication complementary among the headquarters and agencies of the United nations systems in order to prevent overlaps and optimize resources. My country also reiterates its supports for the use of technology in the mandate creation process, in particular highlights the potential of artificial intelligence to streamline information analysis and provide inputs that guide more informed decision making both for Member States and for the Secretariat in planning its work. Furthermore, with the aim of maximizing efficiency and impact and recognizing that the direct cost of meetings in reports exceeded $360 million in 2024, as stated in paragraph 33 of the Secretary General's report, Paraguay calls for reconsiderations based on evidence and factual demonstrations of repetitions of the frequency of resolutions presented annually on recurring issues, especially when their texts reproduce previous versions. In this regard, it proposes moving towards BNL or triennial cycles in order to use resources more efficiently and reduce the burden these repetitions impose on Member states and the system. Finally, PARAGUIDE deems it imperative to prevent committees or technical administrative bodies from turning into arenas of geopolitical confrontation as excessive politicization during the mandate creation stage weakens the ability to deliver concrete results and erodes trust in the organization. Thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank Paraguay. I give the floor now to Cuba and then Belarus.

**CUB**, Representative
Chairs, we appreciate the convening of these informal consultations on the Creation of Mandates under the Unity Initiative Cuba aligns itself to the statement made by Iraq on behalf of the group of G77 and China, and we would like to make the following comments. In national capacity we emphasize that the review of mandate implementation as defined in Work Stream 2 of the UN80 initiative should be focused on analyzing how to improve and ensure optimal compliance with the organization's mandate. Mandates and their validity should not be analyzed for their longevity, but rather for where they have fulfilled the fundamental purpose for which they were created. We are reaffirmed that it is prerogative of Member States to make decisions on the creation of new mandates as well as the modification or termination of the existing ones. We also emphasize that the review of mandate creation should remain under the authority of Member States States and that the operational discretion of the Secretariat should be consistent with the established intergovernmental frameworks. We appreciate that the use of artificial intelligence will be subject to appropriate human oversight and will only be used as a tool to increase investigative capacity in the mandate design process. Furthermore, while we believe that mandates should be clear and as concise as possible, this should not undermine the presence of nuances that are of interest to all Member States. Taking into account, for example, the sensitivity, longevity and scope of a given issue. Cuba reiterates its commitment for constructive participation in in discussions of the UN80 initiative. Thank you very much.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
Thank you, Cuba. I give the floor now to Belarus and then Pakistan.

**BLR**, Representative
Distinguished Co Chairs Dear Colleagues, the Republic of Belarus supports the efforts to strengthen the impact of the United nations and enhancing its agility, responsiveness and resilience while addressing the issue of arbitrary interpretation and duplication of mandates. In this regard, we welcome the creation of a digital mandate registry created through the UN80 initiative. The recommendation to create shorter action oriented texts to facilitate mandate implementary should not impact the effectiveness of the mandate delivery. We are cautious about the proposal to use artificial intelligence to assist with mandate drafting. While this recommendation could be useful for flagging potential complementarities or duplication in draft texts or meeting agendas across mandatory bodies, we emphasize that those tools should not replace the personal engagement of experts and responsibility of UN staff, which is essential for ensuring the quality and integrity of the work of the organization, we also skeptical that involving system wide coordination platforms will help avoid duplication and ensure the strategic use of resources across the United nations system. Belarus reaffirms its support for the efforts of the Secretary General and the Secretariat as a whole, while emphasizing the intergovernmental nature of both their organization and the process of creating, delivering and reviewing mandates, as well as prioritizing or streamlining mandates activities. We underline that decisions and the actual process of resource redeployment cannot be adopted and implemented internally by United nations system entities without the approval of the UN General assembly, even if there is a reasonable justification. Belarus emphasized that financial or operational factors should not be used as justification for modifications, delays or non implementation of mandates adopted by intergovernmental bodies. I thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank Belarus. I give the floor now to Pakistan, to be followed by Brazil.

**PAK**, Representative
Distinguished Co Chairs. Moving straight to the point in terms of procedure, we would like to request that all inputs received to today be published on the dedicated website for this process to ensure transparency. Coming to substance, we would like to raise the following points. First, we would propose that one of the key points Member States should agree on are principles of mandate creation. The Secretary should provide requisite support in this regard. 2. We do not support the inclusion of review clauses in mandates. This has been extensively debated before also and did not garner consensus. Thus, we do not see the utility of repeating this conversation in this Working Group. Third, we do not support the proposal of refraining from mandating new tasks which are not backed by corresponding resources or an explicit reduction in other mandated tasks. We believe this is not practical implementable if PBI is to become the defining factor. This would in effect make the UN unable to respond to new and emerging challenges. Fourth, we believe that there needs to be a more faithful application of the phrase within existing resources. At the time of mandate creation. The relevant implementing entity should confirm that they would in actuality be able to implement a given mandate within existing resources. Fifth, on the task within the Secretary General's purview, we stress that combining reports is not within the authority of the Secretariat. Reports are mandated by Member States and cannot be combined unless Member States agreed to do so. Sixth, we believe that the Mandate Registry needs improvement to be more practical in utility. For example, we believe for mandates it should only list those operative paragraphs which lead to a PBI impact. Currently it just seems to list all of these. I thank you. Thank you, Pakistan. I give the floor now to Brazil, who will be our final Speaker.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
Thank you, Co Chairs. My delegation aligns itself with the statement delivery by Iraq on behalf of the group of G77 China and adds the following remarks in international capacity from a holistic point of view and perspective, the creation of mandate should be part of a rationalized and coherent process. In this regard, before initiating any new mandate, we must ensure that existing initiatives addressing the same issue are thoroughly mapped and analyzed. A prior and systematic phase of identifying possible overlaps and readiness would be of fundamental importance to prevent the proliferation of duplicative mandates. In this respect, the use of data analysis, AI based agents and tools could greatly assist in mapping such overlaps and provide objective evidence to inform the decisions before we start a new mandate.

**BRA**, Representative
Secondly and last, we have heard suggestions regarding the possibility of bring certain budgetary aspects of the mandates to this phase of creation, in particular the program implications PBIS to an early stage of their creation. In this context, it would be useful to receive clarification on how such approach could operate in practice and whether it might entail even directly transfer of the budgetary discussion away from the Fifth Committee, which remains the competent technical firm for such deliberations.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
Thank you thank you, Reza. We have heard the last speaker on the list of speakers for this meeting. Given the time, we will not attempt to do a summary here. We will provide that kind of summary at the beginning of the next meeting, which will be a briefing on mandate implementation of on 30 October, which will be then followed by consultations on 14 November. Further information on the mandate implementation briefing will be communicated to Working Group members shortly. Just to remind you that we are available as co Chairs for you to reach out to us directly or by email. We are flexible in terms of the submission of written inputs or suggestions that you may have to us and in that regard let me just finally thank our briefers for their stick to it iveness and for their forthrightness in providing responses. There are still a few remaining questions that emanated from today that we will attempt to provide you with answers for either in writing or at the next briefing. And thank you for demonstrating that we are able to self impose discipline. And to finish exactly at 1pm the meeting is adjourned.

## Session 3: Mandate Implementation Planning (Oct 9, 2025)
Video: /video/k1q/k1q3jsibpv

**IAHWG** | Carolyn Schwalger, Co-Chair
Good morning, everybody. I call to order the informal meeting of the Working Group to hear a technical briefing on mandate creation. On behalf of Ambassador Wallace, I warmly welcome all of you to this technical briefing. We recognize the presence of Ms. Ayaka Suzuki, Director in the Executive Office of the secretary general, and Mr. Christophe Monnier, director of the Program Planning and Budget Division in the Department of Management, Strategy, Policy and Compliance, as well as Her Excellency Ms. Maritza Tan, Permanent Representative of Costa Rica, and Ms. Min Thu Pham, Founder and CEO of Project Starling. Colleagues, we have an important task ahead of us. The UN is at a critical juncture. The UN 80 initiative provides a unique opportunity to build a UN that is more effective, efficient, accountable and capable of responding to contemporary needs. This informal ad hoc working group provides the mechanism for us as Member States, to be constructively engaged in the effort to strengthen the ability of this organisation to deliver concrete outcomes for the people of the planet as envisaged in the Charter. We encourage Member States to seize this opportunity as the first intergovernmental process launched under the UN80 initiative. The this informal ad hoc working group has a particular responsibility to build trust and mutual understanding and to demonstrate that concrete progress can be made on reforms that can strengthen this organisation and improve the effectiveness, efficiency and impact of its work, as outlined in our letter. On the 7th of October we will begin our work with a Discovery phase. This will include consultations among Working Group members and, subject to the interest of Working Group members, research and analysis to ensure our consultations are informed by empirical evidence and data. Today's briefing marks the start of this Discovery phase and will run until mid December. It is the first of three shorts executive level briefings, each of which will focus on one of the three stages of the mandate life cycle creation, implementation and review. The briefings will provide an opportunity for senior leaders to consider the recommendations under each section of the Secretary General's report on the Mandate Implementation Review, which was published on 31 July in more detail. The briefing also provides you with an opportunity to consider other ideas and perspectives and to ask questions. Each technical briefing will then be followed by consultations on the same topic about a week later. At the consultation, Working Group members will have the opportunity to hear responses to the questions posed at the briefing sessions, convey their views on the recommendations provided in the Secretary General's report or by the briefers, and importantly, put forward their own ideas and proposals for consideration. Today's briefing will focus on the topic of mandate creation. We have invited four briefers to speak on this topic, each has been selected for their depth of knowledge and insights on mandate creation, with each offering different perspectives for our consideration. Like all of us here today, they are invested in the effective functioning of the un. Following their presentations, there will be an opportunity for Working Group members to ask questions of our briefers. As noted in our letters of 7 and the 10October, we remind colleagues that today's session is focused on providing Working Group members with information. We welcome members wishing to deliver statements outlining their perspectives and proposals on mandate creation, to do so at the consultations scheduled for 23rd of October. And I now give the floor to my Co Chair, Ambassador Wallace.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you so much, Co Chair. And we will move immediately into the work for today. I will therefore give the floor to Mr. Ayaka Suzuki, Director in the Executive Office of the Secretary General, to brief the Working Group on current practice exercised in the creation of mandates and to provide an elaboration on the recommendations contained in the Secretary General's report on mandate creation. I also invite her to update the Working Group on progress in taking forward the recommendations in the report that lie within the Secretary General's existing authority as Chief Administrative Officer and what further support the Secretariat may be able to provide to Member States when creating mandates, including access to data and analysis. Mr. Zukey, I give you the floor.

**UN Secretariat** | Ayaka Suzuki, Director, EOSG
Thank you very much, madam. Co chair. Mr. Co chair, good afternoon, or good morning rather. Excellency and Distinguished Delegates, thank you so much to the Co Chairs for inviting us to deliver a briefing today. It's a great pleasure to be here. So today we will walk through key insights and suggestions from the Mandate Implementation Review Report which was issued on 31st of July. And the focus today, as mentioned by the Co Chairs, is the creation phase, where mandates are made and how better visibility, design and stronger collaboration and enhanced support could improve delivery of mandates with a bigger impact. With this presentation, my team and I hope to contribute to a shared understanding of this process. So first, let us just recall from the report that every mandate has a life cycle. If you could advance to the next slide, that would be great. So creation, delivery and review, ideally connected via feedback. When mandate creation is clear and coordinated, delivery improves and review produces learning that in turn improves the next iteration of the mandate. Based on the insight in the report, our goal is structure, strengthening our support to you in that first step so that the whole system can perform better. So before I dive in, let me answer a simple question. How would one define a mandate in simple terms? And for the purpose of the report, we're treating a mandate as a request or directive for action written in the operative paragraphs of of a resolution or decision adopted by mandating organs such as the General Assembly. It is the instruction that tells the United nations or other implementing entities that Member States have asked it to do. This slide shows how a resolution might translate into mandates and results so for example, in resolution General assembly resolution on the pattern of conferences, which was adopted in December 2023, which is the mandate source, contains a request to the Secretary General to produce a report on conferences. This report needs to be planned and budgeted in the program budget. Post and non post. Resources need to be approved so that the requested report can be prepared. Ideally, the report is delivered on time and has data to support your review of our performance and informed decisions on how to improve is a simple chain Decisions, Mandates, Actions and results for Mandate creation the report identifies limited visibility as a key challenge which is the situation today across the UN system. Mandates originate from many bodies, not just the main organs of the United nations, but also mandating organs of specialized agencies or related organizations. Since 1946, more than 40,000 resolutions have been adopted in the General Assembly, Security Council, ecosoc and Human Rights Council alone. However, most bodies lack straightforward and up to date registries, let alone a registry that looks across all of these bodies. That increases the risk of unintended duplication and overlap. The review therefore recommends building comprehensive registries and strengthening coordination among secretariats that are supporting these governing bodies. In short, visibility matters because it is hard to manage better what is hard to see. So to start closing that visibility gap, we have launched mandates.un.org which was launched, as you may recall, in conjunction with the release of the Mandate Implementation Review Report. This site compiles the source documents the UN entities cite when explaining why their programs exist and why they need resources. You can search by entity, mandating organ or subject, and quickly see links between mandate sources and proposed programs. It is interactive and we encourage everyone who have not tried this to explore it. New features are also regularly added. I personally find this to be a very exciting new tool. Here is a concrete example to see what you might find when you use this tool. Youth. You can see how the same subject of Youth appears in 48 resolutions or decisions across eight different bodies the General Assembly, ECOSOC, Security Council, Human Rights Council, and so on. Some 30 UN entities cited these sources 128 times in support of programs proposed for 2026. Sometimes it's helpful, sometimes it may be duplicative and may include extra reporting. Using this tool, mandates un.org we can immediately trace potential overlaps and their sources. As I said, everything's interactive and you could click and it links you to necessary documents later. Ambassador Schwalger, we talked about disability. We have an example of that as well, and we can take a look at that. So visibility is only the first part. The design of mandate shapes how well they can be delivered. And here three challenges stand out. Longer text resolutions are getting lengthier and more complex. More prescriptive wording, which leads to less flexibility for implementation and tasking within existing resources without reducing previously mandated tasks, is becoming more frequent. And it's now appearing more often than even budget is, even as budgets decline. So the report proposes four potential remedies. First, better secretariat support during drafting. Second, AI tools that can help flag potential duplications or complementarities. Third, mandates framed so that the Secretary General can allocate the task to those with the best comparative advantages. And fourth, avoiding new tasks without corresponding resources or reduction in tasks. The message here is clarity, flexibility and practicality. These are what make mandates deliverable. Now, creating better mandates is a shared responsibility. In simple terms, it takes people, guidance and tools that we have summarized on this slide. People capacity, the Technical Secretariat, subject matter experts and training or tools to support efficient drafting, guidance and frameworks to help negotiators craft better processes and language on mandated activities, entities and resource implications. Data and AI tools, registries and drafting modules that flag overlap before it happens. Together, we believe these elements can form the basis of renewed collaboration between all of us. So let me end with three key takeaways. First. First, visibility matters. More accessible information prevents duplication and improves coordination. Second, design drives delivery more concise, clear, properly resourced mandates achieve real impact. Third, enhanced support, stronger people guidance technology and support to assist your work. Our next briefing in the next iteration of this series will go deeper into delivery and resources resourcing. But for today, our core message is simple. And again, this is for the creation phase of the mandate life cycle. Visibility leads to better design leads to stronger delivery equals greater impact. Thank you and I look forward to your questions and reflections. And thank you for giving me the opportunity.

Co Chairs thank you so much, Ms. Suzuki, and to your team for preparing such an interesting and informative presentation. I now give the floor to Mr. Christophe Monnier, Director of the Program Planning and Budget Division in the Department of Management, Strategy, Planning, Policy and Compliance, to brief the Working Group on the relationship between mandate creation and the UN budget process, including how it currently works and how it might be improved.

**UN Secretariat** | Christophe Monnier, Director, PPBD (DMSPC)
Christoph thank you, Ambassador Wallace. And thanks to Ambassador Schrager and Ambassador Wallace, the co Chair of the Working Group, for having us today and giving us this opportunity of the briefing on the I'll pass a few moments to explain a few concepts and then discuss a bit more on the budget part. So on the Legislative framework, the purpose of this slide is to explain how we define a mandate in a budget context and link it to the budget process. So legislative mandate as indicated by my colleague Ayaka is a request for action that is addressed to the Secretary General on Executive Head, acting on his behalf in a resolution or decision adopted by a competent United nations intergovernmental organ. And this is governed by the policy document we call PPBME that has a very long name you see on this slide. The budget themselves are also driven by such requests for action and the Rule 153 of the Rules of Procedure of the General assembly provides two checkpoints to ensure that Member States are fully aware of the resulting resource requirements, one before a resolution is recommended for approval by a Committee and a second checkpoint before approval by the General assembly following a review by the ACABQ and the Fifth Committee. Now how are budget derived from resolution and decisions? The resolutions or decisions I'll be speaking only about resolution for simplification, but I always mean both are what drives the results based budget containing the program plan and the resource proposals. In a resolution we typically have two aspects the preambler paragraphs which express the background, sentiment and concern of Member States and the operative paragraph that provide guidance and mandates for the Secretariat or other stakeholders. The concerns expressed in the preambler paragraph help the Secretariat to formulate a long term objective which reflects the desire and State to address the needs of Member States and the operative paragraphs contain the mandates for the Secretariat to determine the deliverable and output which the Secretariat is expected to produce in order to contribute to the collective achievement of the objective. The strategy is what links the both and is the plan approach to produce the mandated deliverable to meet the needs of Member States and most effectively contribute to the long term objective. On the left side you see the performance measures that are there to demonstrate the progress made, while on the right hand side the inputs on the purple box are the budgetary resources that are required to fund the activities undertaken by the Secretariat to produce the mandated deliverables. So we now focus on those budgetary resources. You've heard us talk about program budget implications. Those are linked to a resolution that indicates that resource that has implications resource implication so a pbi, how we call it is prepared in response to a draft resolution with mandate to the Secretariat to conduct new or expanded activities. It is communicated to Member States prior to the adoption of of a draft resolution and is then later issued as a supplementary budget to request additional resources to implement mandates not included in the current approved budget or proposed budget. After that, it's considered by the ACABQ and then the Fifth Committee before being approved through a formal decision of the General Assembly. Alongside approval of the resolution, we have a different format for PBIS called Oral Statement. Those are used instead of a PBI when we have three situations. Either the resource implications are not yet known and are pending future decision by Member States, for example, if the format and location of a new meeting or conference is still to be defined if the frequency or size of a new report is also to be defined. The second case is when the resource implications are known but will be communicated in a subsequent revised estimate, possibly grouping several program budget implications. This is how, for example, we proceed with PBIS resulting from ECOSOC decisions or from the Human Rights Council. The third situation is when resource implication relates to a future proposed program budget not yet issued by the Secretary General. The resource implication will be proposed in the relevant future proposed program budget, for example, if anything is done today with an impact on 2027 or later, because those are not yet proposed program budget. Now if we look at the budgetary implications are clearly directly influenced by nuances in the language used in the resolution. Without fully getting into the details of this slide, I wanted to mention how the language of the operative paragraph of a resolution drives the understanding by the Secretariat of the intent of Member States to be interpreted as having potential budgetary implications. The resolution must contain a binding request for action and require new or expanded activities. In the interest of time, I will not develop further at this stage, but I would like to highlight the need to ensure the mandate creation process makes the intent of Member States very clear. To warrant the implementation by the Secretariat or the UN system corresponds to the expectations on the aspect of costing resolutions. I'd like to mention that upon reviewing a draft resolution, the Secretariat conducts an internal review to determine the workload related to the required activities and whether these activities can be absorbed within existing resources or what additional resources will be required. The tool presented by my colleague Ayaka would be instrumental in helping both Member States and the Secretariat identifying connections, synergies or potential duplication with existing deliverables and activities. Technically, the use of the expression within existing resource in the draft resolution of the Main Committee does not preclude budgetary implication if the Secretariat assesses that the delivery of those additional mandated activity cannot be absorbed within existing resources. I know that the use of the expression has become more frequent over the years and is quite unpopular amongst my colleagues. I feel, however, that it could be a good indicator of the true intent of Member State within existing resources signals to the Secretariat that Member States expect the additional activities to be of a relatively low impact and to be absorbed within existing resources, accepting de facto that those existing resources originally given for other mandated activity will now be shared for those additional mandated activity, possibly leading to a lessening of some other activities. The absence of this expression within existing resource signaled to the Secretariat that that Member States are ready to consider providing additional resources for those new mandated activities as assessed under the strict principle governing in particular the revised estimates relating to the proposed program budget for 2026 with an expectation of delivery under an efficient framework, making full use of possible synergies and avoiding duplications and this will be my last slide in terms of support to Member States in linking the mandate creation and the budgetary resources. We have in place briefings to the main Committees on the PBI process and we are open to provide them more frequently or to larger audience and to enrich them to better meet the requirements of Member States and are very interested in your feedback on those in terms of support on the drafting. While we are actively supporting the process today, improvements could be made to be more present throughout the maturation of the resolution, but this would require additional focus resources. In addition, it's also noted that during conferences the same drafting consultation with PPBD does not usually take place and this is a weak point that might require further discussions on improving the review and presentation of program plans. We review the mandates and deliverables annually to identify those no longer required to be referenced and and potential streamlining of activities to ensure effective use of resources in the implementation of mandates. The outcome of this Working Group and proposal Under Work Stream 3 would provide opportunities for further strengthening program plans. The revised estimate report on the program budget and support account that I mentioned earlier reflects some of these areas where program managers have identified areas where they can increase the use of existing mechanism to identify opportunities to consolidate and streamline work, including recommendations to change the frequency, format or terminate specific outputs and deliverable. Mr. Chair, thank you very much.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank Mr. Monnier for that interesting presentation. I now invite Her Excellency Maritza Chan, Permanent Representative of Costa Rica, to provide insights from the perspective of of a Member State who has been involved in the creation of mandates in a number of different capacities. Ambassador Chan, the floor is yours.

**CRI** | Maritza Chan, Permanent Representative
Thank you, Ambassador, Excellency, Colleagues, I wish to thank Ambassador Schwager and Wallace for inviting me to share our views. We're certain that with your leadership this will be a successful process. Mandates are truly at the heart of of everything the United nations does. Each mandate reflects an agreement among Member States on how to address an issue and what action needs to be taken. Yet the current context compels us to be more deliberate in how we create mandates. I will share key observations from Costa Rica's experience in either chairing, co facilitating or presiding over different intergovernmental processes. I will highlight persistent experiences which reveal both affected approaches and persistent challenges. A positive example comes from the 2024 conference to review progress in the implementation of the Program of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate Illicit Trade in Small Arms Allied Weapons in all its aspects. RepCom4 in response to the new technological developments such as polymer and modular weapons and 3D printing, Member States agree to establish an Open Endeavor Technical Expert Group. This mandate was needs driven. It emerged from real challenges, focus narrowly on actionable outcomes and build on previous commitments while adapting to new context. The Small Arms and Light Weapons Fellowship Program exemplifies a mandate designed for direct impact. When a mandate is clearly justified, appropriately scope and linked to current realities, it strengthens the UN capacity to respond. A second experience I'd like to share is the 2024 negotiation of the Modalities Resolution for the High Level Meeting on addressing the existential threats posed by sea level rise. The General assembly decided to convene a high level meeting within existing resources, but later on it became evident that those existing resources would not be enough. Additional throughout the negotiation process, delegations recognized that the meeting alone would not suffice for the UN to properly start to address this issue. So three additional mandates were created a Secretary General's report with inputs from Member states, a political declaration, and the High Level Meeting itself. This case highlights two points. First, new thematic areas often require new mandates to build institutional attention from the ground up. Secondly, early coordination with DGACM was essential to anticipate budgetary implications and whether mandates can be realistically implemented and properly resourced. When chairing the first committee in 2024, we observed a third example with both potential and pitfalls. During the 29th session, the committee adopted 77 draft resolutions and decisions. However, only 27 were adopted without a vote. The remaining 50 required recorded votes with 156 separate specific paragraphs votes requested, leading to 201 total votes compared to 148 the previous year. Of course, not all resolutions create mandates. Mandates are created by resolutions or decisions with operative or actional elements. Many resolutions have operative paragraphs that in fact do not invoke action, and frequently operative paragraphs which invoke action are unclear in their intent. Sometimes this is the result of finely balanced negotiations, sometimes it is unintended. Extracting mandates from resolutions and decisions can lead to the Secretariat and wider UN system which implements them to have to make subjective decisions about Member States intentions. As we all know, many resolutions are long, repetitive and lacked sunset clauses or review clauses. One off resolutions are by far the exception rather than the norm. Many also include rollover annual requests for compilations of State views that carry production cost. While the compilations themselves gather little interaction, bringing into question the value of the requests themselves, what at the same time show the difficulty for States to follow up on those requests? This is a problem in several committees. This combination of voting fragmentation, procedural inefficiency and no engagement outputs compel us to ask fundamental questions in a Committee such as the first committee when in 2024 only 27 out of 77 resolutions and decisions achieved consensus. Should we pursue more resolutions annually or would fewer, better focused proposals on biennial or triennial cycles allow time for genuine consensus building? Similarly, we must question whether to continue commissioning Secretary General's reports and annual compilations at the rate we have been doing so when resources are constrained and engagement remains minimal. For instance, first committee mandates that consistently receive fewer than 10 replies could transition to less frequent reporting cycles, allowing the Secretariat to focus resources on higher quality, more impactful outcomes and provide states with more time to fulfill the requirements requirements. Another example is my experience as Vice President of the ECOSOC Humanitarian affairs segment in 20242025 we received divergent views about the annual resolution, particularly its overlap with the General assembly omnibus Humanitarian Resolution. Both segments traditionally produced negotiated outcome documents through repetitive annual discussions. In 2025, Costa Rica took a different approach. Instead of negotiating yet another formal outcome document, we issue a Call to Action. This shorter, more strategic document, developed through streamlined consultation with Member States, sent a strong collective message of support to those affected by humanitarian emergencies and to the humanitarian system. Instead, the result 151 states supported the call to action, a commitment beyond ECOSOC's membership. How can we improve mandate creation? Now turning to this question of improving mandate quality and discipline, I would like to make five points. Firstly, mandates are more likely to be implemented and deliver quality outcomes for people and planet if they are created thoughtfully at the outset. Secondly, there is a growing trend of resolution coming commissioning SG reports. In my experience, the SG reports that actually get read and used are the ones with expert analysis. We saw this with the new topics like AI, they sparked real debate because they offer insight, not just aggregation. A shift from compilation to analysis in SG reports would be transformative. Thirdly, before we create more mandates, we need to map what we already have. When we spotted the duplication between ECOSOC and the General assembly humanitarian resolutions, we addressed it, but that was one case we happened to notice. We need systemic visibility and thus I welcome this fund finding in the SG report on Monday. Implementation Review Fourthly, some simple tests might help us understand whether a mandate we have created is of sufficient enduring interest to the collective membership. Does a mandate with which commissions and SG report get more than 20 responses does a mandate which establishes an agenda item on the UN's books result in engagement from more than a dozen states? Has the mandate produced something concrete in three years? Are the costs reasonable for what the mandate produces? And how would we know unless a monitoring and evaluation mechanism is built in? If we can say yes to to these questions, should it trigger a review of the mandate? Fifthly, I welcome the proposal in the ESRI report which suggests the Secretariat could do a better job of assisting Member States to create higher quality mandates. I encourage the Secretariat to engage with Member States, including those who lead initiatives. Observe as co facilitators or co chair for process on what this support could look like. This is also a shared responsibility. All co facilitators should seek that assistance from the start of each process. Finally, I'd like to add one more thing. Leadership makes a real difference in how mandates are created. It matters who the PGA designates to run a negotiation, and it matters what experience those persons bring. We've seen that skill facilitation can turn a contentious process into a productive one, and that preparation and institutional knowledge help Member States find common ground. Getting the right people in these roles is how we create mandates which delivered meaningful outcomes. I thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank Ambassador Chan for that interesting and thought provoking presentation. I now invite Ms. Mintu Pam, co Founder and CEO of Project Starling, to provide insights and lessons learned from the last intergovernmental process to consider reform of mandates in 2006 in which she played a central role within the UN secretariat.

**Project Starling** | Minh-Thu Pham, Founder & CEO
Thank you so much. Thank you Excellencies. And thank you Ambassador, the Ambassadors from Jamaica and New Zealand for inviting me here to address you all. Ladies and Gentlemen, distinguished guests, as Ambassador Wallace has just mentioned, I had the, the fortune, or maybe for some the misfortune of being designated within Kofi Annan's office actually 20 years ago now in October of 2005, to lead the Secretariat's mandate review to support the Member States mandate review. And so my comments draw from that experience. And I was heartened to hear that so many of you wanted to hear about what were some of the lessons from that time. So let me get right to it. The 2006-2007 mandate review, one of the core lessons from that is that a detailed backwards looking intergovernmental review of existing mandates was unmanageable. The reason for that is because you don't have the information that you Member States need to do a full review of past and current mandates, including and especially budgetary information that would be required. And third, success for this mandate review, you should carefully think about what are the criteria for success. I was encouraged to see that the co facilitators have laid out a really constructive process, I think, for how you might consider the mandates and especially the process by which mandates are created, delivered and reviewed. And that success should not be reviewed. Success should not be determined based on how many mandates you get rid of. As you heard from Ms. Suzuki earlier today, mandates can be everything from establishing an organization to just designating a report to be written. And those are very, very different types of mandates. So if you say we got rid of one mandate, that could have been the issuing of a report or an entire institution or agency or fund or program within the un. Those are very different things. So just consider how you consider success. Mandates are carefully negotiated outcomes of extensive and often contentious intergovernmental negotiations. You all know that very, very well. Reviewing all existing mandates could mean that you are relitigating decades of difficult compromises. The current governments that are in place now, the ones that you all lead, would be forced to rehash agreements that were made by their predecessors and that would reopen old wounds. You are in a different political context right now. And rehashing old mandates that may or may not still be relevant, I think would reopen those old wounds. And I think you may find that you'll be relitigating 80 years of diplomacy. I have to say the process that the co facilitators have taken to look forward is the way to help build goodwill and trust, which is needed at the beginning of an extensive reform process. In 2006 and 2008, member states took a clerical approach to avoid reopening old wounds. That was the right call at that time, given that the 2006 World Summit's directive, meaning the language that was in the World Summit outcome, was to, quote, review all mandates older than five years, originating from resolutions of the General assembly and other organs. That meant that we did not have the option that you have in front of you now, which is to look forward at the mandate life cycle and what should be done to put in place the systems to make it better. The reason why the past mandate review didn't work so well was because the directive was to review old mandates older than five years. And back then, after two and a half years of tedious work to examine individual mandates for duplication and delivery, the process simply lost steam. In fact, I left the Secretary General's office in the middle of 2007, about halfway through, because I also lost steam this time, I suggest that we look forward. Just as the co facilitators have advised you. You will always find more unity looking forward into the future than looking backwards into the past. You should focus instead on the fundamental reason why we have a mandate problem, the mandate life cycle. And it really is a cycle. It's a feedback loop. How mandates are created is really a byproduct of what happened before then and what exists currently within the system. It's really encouraging to see that the Secretary General has addressed the systemic challenge in his report. And that was something that we in 2006 in Kofi Annan's office also highlighted at the time. We had to focus on old mandates because of the World Summit's mandate. But I really do urge you to follow the lead this time, to look into the future. If you take decisions to strengthen the way that we create and monitor mandates, you'll be better off, the UN will be better off, and you'll enable us also to potentially refresh our existing programs. What do I mean by that? Here's the core problem. Member states create mandates to address transnational problems. So there are challenges in the world that you see the UN playing a role to address. And yet, too often, as the Secretary General's report indicates, you have to do this without full insight into what already exists across the UN system. You don't know in fact what's working, what's potentially overlapping, and where right resources could be shifted or what programs could be updated to then respond to the challenge that you're having to address. In the absence of that visibility, decisions rely on incomplete information or even your own national analyses rather than shared evidence that you all are working from the same set of information. And as you all know not every member state can conduct their own national analyses. As a result, this often results in fragmentation, which you all know is a major problem within the system where some parts of the UN are perceived as more effective than others. This can also increase politicization in the intergovernmental decision making process where you're all relying on your own information or your own perceptions as to what needs to be done. The Secretariat is capable of providing the assessments of implementation and that is essential for you to create new mandates. However, that requires investment and I know that's not something we're talking about necessarily in an environment of budgetary austerity, but it really does require investment. Around the world, well run organizations devote about 3 to 10% of their budgets to program evaluation. You all know this within your own bureaucracies, the UN system, and this is my own calculation, and it was our calculation back in 2006 that the UN spends likely closer to about 1% or less than 1% of its budget on proper program evaluation. You don't know what's happening if you don't have a sense of the assessment of how the programs are working. And I'd encourage that perhaps the Secretariat or others can provide you with this specific number. How much does the UN actually devote to proper program evaluation? If we strengthen the UN's capacity to do internal, meaning self, evaluation, as well as external independent evaluation, meaning externally validated assessments of the UN's work that would provide you with evidence that can then inform your creation of mandates, Member States, you all have to be given the information so that you understand and can then discuss and adopt new mandates. Essentially, it's so that you can be better custodians of your mandates. This is essentially what Secretary General Kofi annan recommended in 2006 and what the current Secretary General has just suggested in his report. In that 2006 assessment, we realized that we had to significantly invest in evaluation capacity across the system. That includes oios, the Joint Inspections Unit, and then individual program based inside the departments and offices and agencies self evaluation so that you could then have better streamlined reporting and more transparent understanding of what is actually required budgetary wise when you ask for a new mandate and when the Budget Office is then giving you a program budget implication. This is the essence of evidence. Informed policymaking. In the Secretary General's recent report under Mandate Creation, here's my recommendation. He recommends that improving Secretariat support for Member States during mandate creation and that you need to complement budget estimates with information on related programmatic activities across the system. I think that's absolutely necessary. And I would urge you all to consider going one step further. Build into every mandate budget a modest dedicated percentage for evaluation, so that from the outset, when a mandate is created as part of the cycle, you are building in implementation, learning and assessment as part of the design of mandates. If we don't know, and we're not budgeting for the system to understand how well and whether your mandates were implemented, there's no way you would know what should be the next mandate that you create for those of you, Because I've suggested a forward looking approach for those of you who are concerned about reviewing existing mandates. What do we do about the backlog of our existing mandates, the thousands that we've discussed, and to know whether they are duplicative or overlap or even remain relevant? I'd suggest that the best solution is not to conduct another sweeping review, at least not yet, maybe a little bit later in your phases, but rather to make these changes, investing in understanding what the visibility across a system of the mandates are, and then whether or not the evaluation is there to know how well those mandates are being done. If you do that, then you'll know whether or not the existing mandates are still relevant or even if they've been delivered well. What you need is the information that tells you not only what activities took place, which is essentially what the content of many of the UN's reports are, but also you need to know, what difference did it make. That information strengthens transparency, accountability, and ultimately public trust, which is in short supply these days, especially in institutions like this one. And this can be reported back to you in a way that enables even the smallest of missions. I know how strapped, because I work with so many of you, how strapped some of the smallest missions are. You cannot read the thousands of reports that the UN issues every day, every day, every year. So it's so important so that you can really understand and then credibly adopt new mandates. So my appeal to you today is not about an issue that's going to make the headlines. It's about the quiet systems that ultimately make multilateral cooperation work. I've devoted my career to improving how the UN delivers because I know personally what a functioning UN can do. My life is. I'm here because of the un. When I was three, after the war, my family fled Vietnam by boat. We were rescued by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and brought to a refugee camp that UNHCR ran in Indonesia before being resettled. My life is shaped by the UN's ability to work when it works well when it's adequately funded, when we invest in knowing how well it works, the UN can save lives and expands what's possible for millions. Strengthening your ability to better adopt mandates with better evaluative information, with better visibility across the system, so that the UN can learn and adapt is one of the surest ways that it can continue to do so. This was a huge lesson from 2006. The poet Edna St Vincent Millais said, life is not one thing after another. Life is not one thing after another. It's one damn thing over and over again. Her point was that life keeps repeating itself and the same problems keep coming up again and again. I can't believe that I'm here 20 years later talking to you about something that is a scar. I'm still recovering from the 2006 mandate review. But by improving, you really have a great opportunity right now. By improving the mandate life cycle, as has been proposed, and building into that the budget that is needed to do evaluation, by addressing these systemic issues, you can try to prevent the same mandate problems from coming up again and again. I thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you so much, Ms. Pham, for those insights and for that personal touch as well. The impact of this organization is legendary. It's our task to make sure that it remains so going forward. In the time remaining, I'm going to now open the floor for any questions from delegations on the briefings we have just heard. I'm just going to remind you, delegations, that this briefing will be followed in a week or 10 days by informal consultations at which there will be an opportunity for delegations to deliver prepared statements to ensure today that we can take as many questions as possible in the next half an hour. We're asking that you keep your interventions short, no longer than a minute and a half or so. With that, I give the floor to the distinguished representative of the European Union, to be followed by China.

**EU**, Representative
Thank you. Co chairs supremely appreciate this opportunity today. And the briefers very enlightening and full support for your work. I have three very, very short questions. The first one has to do with the discussion that was opened by Project Startling now about the existing mandates. I do understand the experience of 2004, but back then, of course, all the tools that were described by the Secretary this morning, the AI tools in our disposal, the knowledge of every single mandate out there, the capacity to combine them and see all their overlaps, those didn't exist back there. So one question is, could those tools, or how could those tools also help us if we were to, if they were to be applied to existing mandates and would you need more or different kinds of tools when you look at existing mandates as opposed to advising on new ones? And to the cofax, A question on this and to everyone else really, can we envision a possibility for the Member States in the committee process itself to be able to work on the evaluation, assessment of mandates, implementation of them, making sure that the UN itself helps implement its own mandates in a conscious of potentially given that limited time, avoiding looking perhaps at some sessions, at the discussion of renewals of mandates, renegotiation of mandates, all those things and instead focus on implementing them. Does that make sense? Second question has to do with related to the first with tying adoption to implementation assessment. Can you please tell us how many mandates today already have a sunset clause, if any do how many do have a built in monitoring, assessment, evaluation mechanism, implementation mechanism, how those are working? Are they working well or are they not working well? Now a third question has to do with badger allocation itself and to understand which mandates you know, have which badgered requirements. I do not know if the best way is to ask do we have the top 50 most expensive mandates in the UN system? And if we do, can we look at the details of those and understand what costs what and whether or not we could achieve better results in implementing those mandates by cutting out some of their elements? But obviously we cannot ignore the cost. So we have to be able to do that exercise. So that's the question, a final question. The suggestion which makes a lot of sense when mandates are being are asking for within budgetary resources, but in fact that's not possible. There's a suggestion that there's more flexibility given to the Secretary General to be able to allocate those limited resources to different mandates. Like I said, that makes a lot of sense. We do not have unlimited money, obviously, and that's why we're having this exercise in addition to trying to make our lives better and more effective at the un stop renegotiating things all over again and bring a collective power together as Member States to implement things we have decided. But what criteria would the Secretary General then use, do you think or has used up to now that you consider particularly effective in making those decisions on how to allocate those more limited resources through increased flexibility. Thank you.

I thank the distinguished representative of the European Union. I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of China

**CHN**, Representative
Co Chairs. Mandate creation marks the beginning of the mandate life cycle. Just like fasten the first button on a shirt, it must be done properly from the start Listening. I listened very carefully with the briefings and I would like to raise three questions. First, regarding the online registration of mandates, could you please provide information on the resources that have been invested in the development of the registration system so far, as well as the resources and funding resources that will be required in the future? Second, only corresponding resources for mandate creation. The Secretary General's report recommends strengthening the linkage between mandate creation and corresponding resources and providing more comprehensive budget estimates for new mandates. What impact would this have on the current budget preparation process, in particular on the work of the Committee for Program and Coordination and the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly? Third, concerning the use of artificial intelligence, what type of data does the Secretariat intend to feed into these tools? What measures are planned to ensure the secure management of this entire process, including data input, content generation, result verification and integration and optimization? And what is the estimated financial cost of these activities? And I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Co Chair by circulating the work of plan which demonstrate a spirit of openness and transparency. In conclusion, I want to strike a optimistic tone now. The Secretariat and also the UN's work is multiplying in terms of the rapid change of international situation. So we need to really keep the work with the pace of the times, rather than simply compare this times work with the work we have done before and label the previous previous work as a failure. Thank you.

Thank you Co Chair. And thanks to both of you for this. Having listened and recognizing the one thing that came through was the design. So I must congratulate both of you for thinking carefully about the design of this process. I think this discovery phase will benefit not only us, but the entire system. So I just want to register South Africa's appreciation for the discovery phase that you've done throughout the process and of course for sharing it openly with all of us. And thank the presenters as well. I think your process design ensures that there's partnerships with the system and Member States. So thank you to the system for helping us understand deeper Two questions from our side. One is understand the preambler paragraphs and their purpose, understand the operative paragraphs and this is where you extract the mandate. But can you tell us how you do that, given that some of the operative paragraphs are not very clear? So if you can share that, it will be very helpful. Similarly, appreciating the registry that you have put together, is there any way we can classify the mandates to say these ones that are asking for reports and there are so many of them, these are the ones that are creating new entities and there are so many just some kind of classifying mandates. Thank you. Thank you again.

I thank the distinguished representative of South Africa. I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Liechtenstein to be followed by the United States.

**LIE**, Representative
Thank you so much to both of you all. Protocol observed and thanks to the, to the briefers extremely helpful briefings presentations this morning. Morning. And we do, we do like this format so thank you for this. I will have a couple of questions. I mean it was particularly useful for me to hear the comments on the budget. I think the term visibility was used quite a bit. What we are looking for a little more is also transparency because I think the reality is we often don't know how much the things cost that we mandate. And my experience is also that we often actually don't know if a mandate that we're drafting is, is linked to a PBI until extremely late. So I've been involved in negotiations or it's like oh this is a big question. Is there going to be a PBI or is there no pbi? But I think the reality is also even without a PBI a resolution does entail costs. So that is for us important. And we'll comment on other issues such as SG reports and the famous phrase within existing resources when we have this opportunity. In informals my questions are linked to my brief comments and the first is what methods can be used to link newly created mandates in the future with the reduction of consolidation of older ones in order to maximize the efficiency of the use of resources. Think that links also you know the forward looking perspective that that has been advocated in the discussion with what we also need to address as far as what you already have. And the second question relates also to my comments namely what additional information can be provided besides regular budget estimates to ensure full funding transparency for newly created mandates. Because I really think that has been one of the the things that we have not been doing well on, well at all on in the past and something that I hope can be fixed relatively easily.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you. I thank the distinguished representative of Liechtenstein. I give the floor to the distinguished representative of the United States who will be followed by Malaysia.

**USA**, Representative
Great. Thank you so much. Kirk chairs and thanks to all the panelists today. Just a couple questions and reactions to follow up on the very useful briefings today. First to Yaku Suzuki. One of the recommendations that you discussed is around giving the Secretariat appropriate flexibility to assign responsibility based on comparative advantage. And I think it would be useful to have more information on what the that would actually look like if there are examples in existing mandates that perhaps could serve as a model as we consider new mandates. Similarly, you talked about, I think the very useful mandate report that the SG produced. I was particularly struck by the the graphic on the last page of that report, which is the heat map looking at overlap across the three pillars of the organization. It would be useful to have a better understanding of clusters of similar mandates that could be potentially a basis for us as Member states to think about consolidation or deconfliction. And the representative of the European Union talked about which mandates were the most expensive. It might also be useful to have a good sense of what mandates do we spend the most time on. And then finally to Christophe Monnier, wearing my 5C hat, a lot of that was of course very familiar. I think it's worth noting that when we use within existing resources and mandates, it's often a political compromise. It's because some in the room don't like the mandate, some do. And the sort of most expedient way of reaching agreement is to say, fine, you can do that, but with no new money. And with that in mind, I think it would be helpful to know both how the Secretariat determines whether, as you said, in circumstances where we have mandated doing something within existing resources, additional resources are needed, or if the Secretariat cannot actually implement the mandate. And similarly, should we be thinking about a threshold below which the Secretariat can absorb those resources, or above which resources actually would be necessary for implementation? Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the Distinguished Representative of the usa. I give the floor to distinguished Representative of Malaysia, to be followed by the Republic of Korea.

**MYS**, Representative
Thank you, Co Chair. Thank you for convening today's briefing and I also thank the Briefers for their useful presentation. I have a question to Ms. Suzuki with regards to the mandate registries. As noted in the Report of the Secretary General, the availability and accessibility of information on existing mandates remain limited. Malaysia joins those who believe that improving access to this information could contribute to more informed and effective decision making by Member States as part of our broader efforts at reform. We also note and support the recommendation to accelerate the creation of comprehensive registries of existing mandate tax issued by all mandating bodies. And we are also encouraged to see that at least the beta version of the UN Mandate Registry has been online and is being expanded in the coming weeks. So my question is, is there a sense of timeline for the completion of the mandate source registry? And my second question would be what are the potential persistent challenges that are being faced in building and completing this registry? Thank you so much.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Malaysia. And I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of the Republic of Korea, to be followed by El Salvador.

**KOR**, Representative
Thank you for the briefing. I have a couple of questions. The SG report identifies excessive prescriptiveness as a problem which may seem a bit counterintuitive because specificity is generally virtue in drafting clear mandates. Is the concern primarily about assigning tasks to specific entities or does it extend to mandates that prescribe in detail how active activities should be done and also for visibility? I wonder myself, would the registries at the current format be sufficient perhaps to avoid duplication, but not so much to ensure coherence to give Member State a full insight of how the existing mandates or duplicative mandates are implemented, coordinated or funded. I just want to listen to how you are going to improve this mandate registry. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of the Republic of Korea. I give the floor now to El Salvador to be followed by Romania.

**SLV**, Representative
Thank you so much Co Chairs for convening this meeting and also to the briefers for the valuable presentations and also to the Secretary for all the efforts highlighting the presentation that Ambassador Maritza Chai gave us. Very comprehensive and with a lot of food for thought precisely in our work. I would like to know if you Co Chairs have also engaged with other Member States precisely that have led intergovernmental processes recently to draw lessons from them that could inform the current review mandate that especially because the report was presented last August and the first meeting was in mid September on the creation of mandates. More specifically and within the context of the current Main Committees now in session. We would like to know if there have been exchanges between the Secretariat Co Chairs of different processes and the Chairs especially of the main Committees to raise awareness of the need to avoid repeating the same pace of creating countless new mandates. Also have the discussions taken place within the committees and that's related from what was previously mentioned of the use of within existing resources when establishing new mandates. And that's precisely seeing what in the framework of the main Committees could be done to avoiding that use of the phrase, whether for political reasons or others. Other questions that we have is regarding the paragraph 29B of the SG report when referring to the need of frame mandates that allow the Secretary General flexibility to assign task based on comparative advantages and resources across the UN system Co Chairs, what exactly will that flexibility mean in practice and related to mandate implementations? Very concrete questions is that has the Secretary identified a sense of competitiveness between agencies within the system, and are there any considerations regarding these cases in the field based, for instance, on the findings of the multiple QCPR reports during the last few years? Thank you, Co Chairs.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you so much. To the distinguished representative of El Salvador. I give the floor now to Romania, to be followed by Pakistan.

**ROU**, Representative
Thank you very much, Co Chairs. And I think I used this analogy before. You are making us looking in the mirror because at the end of the day, Member states are responsible for this important phase of the mandates creation. And I think your brief has covered several important angles. I'm looking at Mintu and I'm wondering if we did not manage it 20 years ago, what would make us confident that we'll make it this time? I think we have to make it this time because there is no, this is not optional. Mrs. Suzuki spoke about the design that drives delivery. This is correct. This is something that we've been looking at together with Matu in the revitalization resolution, how to make resolutions, you know, more streamlined. The demand has to be clearly codified. But I'm still concerned. I mean, if we did not manage to do it 20 years ago, what would it take it this time? And I'm interested from, from the Secretariat, probably, and all the panelists, what exactly benchmarks, criterias we may develop in addition to what we had developed so far? I very much like the presentation on the financial impact of our mandates and the way we have explained what exactly a mandate means. And it is correct in my understanding as well, a resolution simply requesting the Secretary General, producer mandate, a report, it's a mandate. And I'm interested, actually, can we go back to the basics in a way, looking at what exactly does it mean from a financial perspective, what is the expenditure related to such a simple task? Because the way I see it, and that's the mirror that we have to look into, we're not even observing our own rules of procedures throughout these processes that we promote through different committees of resolutions. We're actually supposed to quantify the financial impact of those resolutions so it doesn't happen. So I would be very much interested how we can quantify in practical terms such a request to produce a report, because it will be giving an important visual for member States. The other point I would like to ask is we scatter different mandates through different resolutions in different bodies. What would be a good way, actually, to make sure that we avoid this duplication and this overlap? Sometimes we talk about. We saw the example with the youth item being handled in a number of resolutions through different bodies, some of them not being in New York. So that's probably one of the key issues that we have to look at. I wonder if any of the panelists may have a different input.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you. I thank the distinguished representative of Romania. I give the floor now to Pakistan to be followed by Mozambique.

**PAK**, Representative
Thank you very much Co Chairs, for convening this briefing. We also thank all the panelists for their insightful presentations. I will save our substantive reflections on the proposals in the SG's report for the next meeting and limit this intervention to three points on which we desire greater clarity. First is on one of the key issues identified in the SG's report that many entities are citing the same mandates in their pbis, implying possible duplicates duplication of efforts to address this. The report recommends that greater flexibility be granted to the SG to assign tasks when designing or implementing mandates. From our perspective, the solution proposed is not necessarily in line with the problem identified. The question would be is it possible for the Secretariat to provide more in depth analysis on how the proposal in the the report would enhance efficiency? In our view, if the mandates formulation remains unclear, it would lead to delays in implementation, interagency conflict, etc. It is the Member States who should spy specify the implementing entity and the Secretariat which should provide adequate support to Member States to make an informed decision. Second is on the proposal for linking new mandates to corresponding resources or reductions elsewhere. We can agree to this principle when Member States are creating new mandates to be implemented within existing resources. However, applying such a principle to all new mandates is a point of concern. We cannot expect the UN to respond to new emerging challenges if PBIS are our overarching concern. So the question here is can the Secretariat inform whether this principle is implementable on all new mandates and not just those which are specified to be implemented within existing resources and what this would imply in practice for recent new mandates. Third, we agree with the proposal for accelerating the creation of comprehensive registries of existing mandate text issued by all mandating bodies. We recall that the 2006 exercise highlighted by Ms. Fam also created a mandate Registry, but we are unaware of its fate. We would like to ask the Secretariat what arrangements are in place to ensure that such registries remain in place even after the Unity Initiative is completed, and we would also be very happy to hear what what you have to respond to the Chinese question about what resources are being spent on the Registry. The creation of the Registry itself. Thank you so much.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished Representative of Pakistan. I give the floor now to the Distinguished representative of Mozambique, to be followed by Ireland.

**MOZ**, Representative
Thank. Thank you Chair. Our co Chairs and we also welcome this discovery phase. And for us this is not only a forward looking exercise. Even as we meet today, new mandates are being created making this a particularly hands on and practical exchange for certain countries such as mine. Strengthening the connection between the political decisions that create mandates and the budgetary realities that sustain them has real life implications. Let me pose a couple three or four questions. First, on visibility and mandate registries, does the Secretariat intend to expand the registry to include specialized agencies so that duplication can be addressed system wide rather than only within the Secretariat? Second, has the Secretariat considered developing model drafting guidance or templates to help delegations avoid the pitfalls that were mentioned such as prescriptive language, the famous within existing resource clauses and others. Third, on AI, will we Member States be consulted on the criteria and methodology those systems will use to flag duplication and complementarities? And finally, in what ways can regional commissions such the eca, the Economic Commission for Africa, contribute to or manage regional mandate registries to enhance coherence in regional ownership? I thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Mozambique. I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Ireland, to be followed by Cuba and then the Russian Federation.

**IRL**, Representative
Thanks very much co facilitators, and thank you to all the wonderful briefings that we had this morning. Much appreciated. One question I had is for Mr. Monnier from the Executive Office of the Secretary General. You spoke about reviewing the mandates annually and identifying mandates that no longer require to be referenced. That's a useful process that you're going through and would be useful to hear more about that and perhaps how it can feed into the current deliberations. And secondly, and finally, yes, we've spoken about the mapping of mandates that we have currently. Which ones are the most expensive, which ones take up the most time or two elements, I would add, which ones have the most impact? But of course that also relates to what Minh Tu was saying. How do we evaluate? How are we able to tell where the impact and results are? So very supportive of thoughts in that regard as we go forward. Thank you very much.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Ireland. I give the floor now to Cuba, to be followed by the Russian Federation.

**CUB**, Representative
Thank you so much Chair for giving me the floor and thanks for this opportunity. We have three questions. First, regarding the ongoing initiative to improve the visibility of the mandate landscape, referring para. 23 of the Secretary General's report, how has the allocation of resources being managed in the context of the equate liquidity crisis facing the Organization for the implementation of these initiatives? Second, regarding the recommendation to grant the Secretary General greater flexibility in mandates to assign tax to entities within the system, taking into account the points raised in para. 28 of the report, we would like to know the criteria or procedures that will be taken into account to assess the suitability of giving entity to implement a mandate. And third, concerning the use of artificial intelligence to support the creation or drafting of mandate text, how will it be ensured that that the relevant political analysis and sensitivity of each issue analyzed by the Organization will not be undermined? Could the Secretariat provide an exhaustive list of the areas of the organizations where in which AI is being implemented? What AI tools are currently in use by the Organization or are being considered for use? How can it be ensured that they are fully respectful of Member States, their positions and their perspective? We would like appreciate receiving right information from the Secretariat for the next sessions of the Ad hoc Working Group. Thank you so much.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the representative of Cuba and I'll give the floor to the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation, to be followed by Nigeria.

**RUS**, Representative
Thank you very much. Ambassadors and colleagues in the Secretariat. I think we have to be thankful to all of us. We're starting the frank conversation which is long overdue. With that frank conversations, my questions are the following. As I mentioned last time, I would love to address not only the part actions by the Member States, but also the part actions by the Secretary General. So I see two conflicting points. One is that the Secretary General is going to approve Secretariat support and the other is that the Secretary General is going to provide shorter reports. So my question is how do these two combine with each other? Because in my opinion, shorter reports are not improved support. Does it mean that the UN Secretariat wants to work less? And does the working less means that the UN Secretariat is ready to receive reduced salaries? My second question also concerns the appropriate flexibility to assign tasks by the Secretary General. We would love to ask how does this is commensurate with the prerogatives of the Member States to control the implementation of mandates. And how does this impact the accountability of the Secretary General? My last point would also the also address the flexibility. Not flexibility, sorry. Also address the conditionality of mandate with the resources. The clause that says that the impact has to be defined first, the source of funding has to be defined first. How does this impact the prerogatives of Member States in determining the provision program of the organization? And last issue just echo the questions about existing resources clause. We understand this is quite a difficult sometimes an outcome for Member States to arrive into decision and consensus. But how the Secretary choose and prioritize in the conditions where it's clearly that resources are not enough. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation. I give the floor to the distinguished representative of Nigeria, to be followed by Iran and then our final speaker will be Argentina.

**NGA**, Representative
Thank you the Co Chairs for this wonderful job. Be rest assured of my delegations full support for achieving a positive outcome in the ongoing review mandates in line with the results or guidelines of giving to the Committee. While we share the view that it is important to look forward, we must also recognize that understanding where we are coming from is fundamental to determine where we are going. A clear appreciation of past mandates and experiences enable us to build more coherent and effective path for the future. The Secretary is always supportive of Member States in terms of resolutions making by extension mandate creation from language, form illumination going forward. So what is the support again that is needed different from what they are doing or giving to Member States and how can they do better? I will appreciate for these cautions. Then lastly, on the issue of duplications of mandates, as highlighted, resolutions from the ga, ECOSOC and Security Council which according to the representative of the Secretariat, how can this time around be better than the previous time given that the administrative bureaucratic process of monitoring and evaluating of this this mandate. And once again I want to also, what do you call it? Ask the question related to what my distinguished colleague from Cuba, on the issue of AI, how are we looking at the transparent usage of the AI? As well as my colleagues from Mozambique, who is talking about entities in terms of their mandate. How can we look at the review as well as the registry creation for their respective mandate? Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Nigeria. I give the floor now to Iran, to be followed by Argentina and then finally Mexico.

**IRN**, Representative
Thank you Excellencies, Co Chairs. All protocols observed. I also wish to thank the Co Chairs for their attention to the past experiences and to the lessons learned from them. A meaningful step forward. As we have previously requested, I wish to raise two questions. First is concerning the artificial intelligence. And as as some colleagues previously said, we know that AI tools are subject to bias and exclusivism and more importantly remain costly and insufficiently developed for application, especially in the highly sensitive context. There are already concerning examples in the context of the un, such as speech to text tools and we all recognize that it is still an evolving technology. Then how do you evaluate this as a supportive element to achieve inclusive outcomes under current financial situation? Second, it relates to the ambiguous Language of mandates, often the result of delicate political compromises which frequently requires clarification during implementation. I would be interested to know whether there is any reflection or statistical data show showing to what extent this ambiguity consumes the Secretariat's time and energy in the interpretation and how often we encounter situations where Member States or groups later express their concerns that the implementation did not fully reflect their intended meaning. Thank you so much.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Iran. I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Argentina and then Mexico.

**ARG**, Representative
Thank you very much. Mr. Co Chair of Protocol observes. I have a question in the context of Rule 153 that was mentioning and the question is what challenges or limitations? Or maybe, if you want to see positively what possibilities do we have to count with PBA estimates well in advance? I would say maybe when the zero draft is presented so we can incorporate the budgetary implications from the beginning of a discussion when a mandate is created and not, I would say at the end, as it is now in the context of the procedure, maybe that would allow us to incorporate from the 0 draft the PBI implications and all be aware of what that means in the context of mandate negotiation.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you. I thank the distinguished representative of Argentina and now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Mexico who will be our last speaker.

**MEX**, Representative
Thank you very much. And I would like to thank the briefers for the very clear and comprehensive presentations. My country, Mexico will be presenting its position on how we see the whole process in a thorough Way on October 23rd. But in the meantime we would like to ask Ms. Mintu Pam if she could go a little bit more into detail on evaluation and monitoring in the creation of new mandates. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Mexico. And I thank the distinguished representative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for making a liar out of me. I give the floor to the representative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

**NLD**, Representative
Thank you Ambassador. And thank you Co Chairs for the inclusiveness of this process. We're looking forward also to the next briefings and avenues for discussion. We also have some questions. First of all, we welcome the establishment of the Registry of Mandates that has the potential to be a useful tool to support states improve mandate design and reduce duplication. What functionalities do you envisage to strengthen its usefulness? A second question would be to ask the Secretary General for a timeline on the implementation of the recommendations of the SG's report. We already saw some shortened reports passing by which we greatly value, but we would like to have additional information on the implementation of the recommendations. On your side, slide AI tools. The third question on AI tools, they have obviously a huge potential to support more informed decision making by States. How do you foresee the implementation of such tools in this process? And I thank you very much for your attention.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. And with that I try to hand the floor back over to my co chair for some summary remarks.

**IAHWG** | Carolyn Schwalger, Co-Chair
Thank you, Ambassador Wallace. And first of all, thank you to all of you. I cannot say how much we appreciate the trust that you have placed in us by working with us in the format and the process as we've prescribed. And we can see that in the presentation of your question and kind of early markers of your intent to come back with fuller ideas and proposals at the session on the 23rd of October. I'd also like to thank the briefers. Each one of you, in your own ways, I think, brought different aspects of this discussion on mandate creation to the fore. This discussion was very rich. It's hard to summarise, but let me at least just touch on a few points before we close on what I think we may have heard today. I was very taken by Mintu's comment that quiet systems make multilateralism work. And I think that is so true and that is the exercise we're embarked on. So it's so great to hear from so many of you that you welcomed the opportunity to hear from some of the lessons we've learned in the past so that we can apply those to our work now and in the future. I heard a lot of commentary around there is a great desire to have better design of the way we make mandates and the reason for that is because we all want to have better delivery and better impact. That came through from both our presenters and from you as well. Having said that, it was always. It was also acknowledged in this discussion that because of the way we negotiate as Member States together, of course some of the ways that we create mandates are a product of our own decision making and sometimes come with unintended consequences, but sometimes come with intended consequences as well. And of course that is completely legitimate. It, however, does raise questions around clarity. We had comments and questions around how are mandates sourced out of the system? How does the Secretariat interpret what we produce as Member States? And we asked and heard a lot of questions around more information. A desire for increased visibility so that that can support delivery. But also transparency came through very strongly as well. It was noted by some in their questions in the briefers that ambiguity can cause challenges for the Secretariat, but can cause challenges for us as Member states too, and our own evaluation or satisfaction on how we believe that mandates are delivered upon or not. There was much discussion around the relationship between the creation of mandates and how resources are allocated to those mandates. Both comments and questions around the information that we need before we start and the better information and understanding of the financial impacts of mandates perhaps before we conclude them. A very strong theme came through today about the importance of monitoring and evaluation, the importance of having better assessments of what we've actually done to inform what we do in the future. And I heard clients comments and questions around not only the impacts of mandates on our finances and our funding, but also on our time and also on our impact. So we have questions there for the briefers as well. Many of you referred to the SG's report. Many of you welcomed some of the recommendations. Many of you had questions about some of the recommendations, whether they were the right recommendations, and some of you who had questions asking for elaboration on some of them as well. There were many questions and comments around the tools, the registry that's been mentioned. What is its functionality, how is it being resourced? We had questions about AI, how can AI help us? But also what are some of the caveats we need to consider when we think about the use of AI in this exercise. Many of you ask questions of about what does giving the SG increased flexibility mean in terms of allocating parts of the system to deliver on mandates. And there was a lot of discussion around the implications of within existing resources. We heard from a couple, including Maritza, about how SG reports are consumed, one of the frequent mandates that we see in resolutions, and there was an encouragement to move from compilation of information to analysis. We also of course heard questions beyond the recommendation in the SG's report and we started to see some flavour and hints of things that you might bring back to us on the 23rd as well. I think there's a great desire to see how the tool that the Secretariat has developed and maybe outside of this format we can ask the Secretary Secretariat to provide a very informal, informal meeting sometime between now and the 23rd where they can show you your experts how the tool works and you can see some of the functionality by testing it on a few case studies that might be something we will commission from the Secretariat. So that was my attempt to summarise this hour and a half or so or almost two hours this morning. I think it's been a really rich discussion and as co chairs we're really thrilled and I'm looking forward to hearing more from you. On the 23rd, but also, of course, before that, as we said at the first session, we remain available to you to meet you individually, to meet you in groups, to meet you in clusters who are interested in particular aspects of this process. So thank you very much again for today. And I have to do the formalities to get close us out. So before adjourning, as previously announced, the next meeting will take place on the 23rd of October. As I said, in the interim, if you wish to meet with us directly in person or by in writing, you can also do so to the email address that we provided in the letters on 7th and 10th of October. But for today, this meeting is adjourned. Thank you.

## Session 4: Implementation Progress Review (Oct 23, 2025)
Video: /video/k11/k11rftq8ch

**IAHWG** | Carolyn Schwalger, Co-Chair
Good afternoon. Again, I call to order the informal meeting of the Working Group to hear a technical briefing on mandate implementation. We warmly welcome all of you to this technical briefing. We recognize the presence on screen for everyone of Mr. Guy Ryder, under Secretary General for Policy and chair of the UN 80 task force. Also His Excellency Christian Venavesa, Permanent representative of Liechtenstein Mr. Martin Kamani, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Africa Centre and former Permanent Representative of Kenya and Ms. Amerihak, the former United Nations Under Secretary General for the Department of Field Support, former CO Chair of the High Level Independent Panel on Peace Operations and former Secretary General Special Representative for Timor Leste and Head of the United Nations Integrated Mission in East Timor. Before handing the floor to our briefers, please allow me to deliver some opening remarks on behalf of the CO Chairs. We wish to take this opportunity to warmly thank all of you for your continued engagement in this important process. The briefing we convened on mandate creation on 13th October was fruitful. It delivered useful information, data and analysis to Working Group members. Your questions to the briefers were incisive and brought to light areas of shared interest. This included questions around the lessons we have learned from previous attempts to to review mandates, the tools we might employ to support visibility of the mandate landscape and the relationship between the mandate creation process and the budgetary cycle. Your remarks at the subsequent mandate creation consultations on 23 October demonstrated that the briefings had stimulated some useful inputs from the Working Group. You presented new ideas about how we might improve the way we work together to create mandates. And we also heard a desire to return to some of the ideas that have been raised in the past. In addition to offering suggestions on general principles that could guide our work, you made concrete proposals of actions to be taken. This included ideas around enhanced support from the Secretariat for those leading resolutions, improved working methods in the Committees and UN bodies where mandates are created, and a recasting of the budgetary process so the financial and time costs of mandates are better understood. Many of you expressed a desire for more discipline in the creation of mandates. Your desire to embrace technology to support our work was tempered with clear statements about the need for human oversight. And you reaffirmed the centrality of Member States as the drivers of mandate creation. We have taken careful note of your inputs to the Working Group and we encourage you to start thinking about the merit of some of the proposals made by your fellow Working Group members and in addition to discussions in this room. That's right. At least you have really great taste in music. Yeah. In addition to discussions in this room, Working Group member inputs are being made available on the UN80 website. Further, we will continue to make ourselves available to you for smaller group discussions. And we really do appreciate the engagement with many of you that we have had to date. Some of you are interested in having a clearer idea of where this process is heading. As we said at the outset, we will be guided by you. At the same time, please be sure that we, as co Chairs, are striving for the highest level of ambition. We believe that reform of the UN is not only desirable, but but inevitable. We want to work with you to ensure that mandates that we create are more impactful, that the resources to deliver them are used wisely and efficiently, and that the processes and working methods we deploy to create, implement and review mandates are less laborious, while remaining inclusive and transparent. We have many options available to us in terms of the outcome of this process. Options include pledges, recommendations, guidelines, reports, decisions and resolutions. But none of these options will be meaningful unless we are genuinely committed to collective implementation. This will require a shift in behaviour, a shift in psychology and a shift in how we communicate with each other. And it will take sustained leadership. Before we settle on the specific modality or outcome from this process, you need to tell us your level of ambition for reform and a demonstrated commitment to implementation. With that, I would now like to pass the floor to my co Chair, Ambassador Wallace, to get us underway with today's discussion. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you, Ambassador Carolyn. Colleagues, we hope that today's briefing on mandate implementation will be as fruitful as our recent discussions on mandate creation. Each of our briefers today have or have had leadership roles in different aspects of mandate implementation across the UN system. We have asked our briefers to share their perspectives on how the mandates are implemented, whether it be well or poorly or unevenly, and ask them to share their ideas on how implementation might be improved. Understanding that the stages of the mandate lifecycle are intricately connected, they may also wish to share insights into the relationship between mandate creation and implementation and review. Before they begin, allow us to share a few thoughts from our perspective. In our many discussions with Member States, the Secretariat, the UN system more broadly and with stakeholders, we have heard widespread agreement that reform is urgently needed to restore public trust and the confidence of political decision makers in the UN and to strengthen its ability to deliver across the its core mandates. During our recent mandate creation briefing and consultations, we could see that Working Group members clearly understand the link between mandate creation and mandate implementation. Mandates that are carefully crafted, assigned and costed that is, those that are created as a result of a deliberate and sound process are well set up for effective implementation from the moment of their creation. Effective implementation of mandates sits at the core of the UN's legitimacy. We encourage Working Group members to keep open minds as you listen to the data and analysis presented to you today. Once you've had a chance to ask questions of the briefers and reflect on what you have heard, we hope you will bring concrete, ambitious and creative ideas to the Working Group at the Mandate implementation consultations on 14 November. From the discussion so far, we are confident that many of your conclusions and suggestions will align with the Co Chair's desire to achieve the most ambitious outcome from this process. As we noted earlier, today's briefers have been selected for their varied experience and perspectives with mandate implementation. Like all of us here today, they are invested in the good functioning of the un. Following the presentations by the briefers, there will be an opportunity for questions from the floor. I will now give the floor to Mr. Guy Ryder, Undersecretary General for Policy and chair of the UN 80 task force. Guy, the floor is yours and thank you for taking the time.

**UN Secretariat** | Guy Ryder, USG Policy
Well, thank you very much, Co Chairs, Excellencies, dear participants, let me first thank you for inviting me to speak at this session of the Working Group focusing on the delivery phase of the mandate life cycle, and allow me at the outset an expression of solidarity and support through you, Ambassador Wallace, to the government and people of Jamaica in the wake of the passage of Hurricane Melissa. I would also like to express appreciation to all of you for your investment in the UN 80 initiative, particularly over the past couple of weeks, which have been really quite intensive. The Secretary General, my colleagues and I have benefited from the multiple engagements with you on the various work streams and the thoughtful feedback and strong commitment you have provided, not least right here in this Working group. Progress is being made. I believe we are on the right path and that working together can and will make a real difference. But I think we all recognize as well that we have a long way to go. Perhaps it would be useful before turning to today's topic, mandate Delivery, to provide you with a very brief update on current developments across the whole of the UN 80 initiative. By way of context, I am joining you virtually because we are currently holding the UN system's Chief Executive Board, which twice a year brings together senior leaders from across the UN system to align on strategic issues and one of the main items on the agenda, and it will be discussed tomorrow morning, concerns next steps in the UN 80 initiative. As the Secretary General said when he briefed you all two weeks ago on Work stream three of the initiative, we are developing an action plan that would establish an internal architecture, assign lead responsibilities and establish timelines to deliver on all action points across the entirety of the UN 80 work streams. I want to stress that this is an internal process and the Action Plan will operate, of course, in the fullest respect of established procedures and Member State prerogatives, in full transparency. Accordingly, we'll be informing Member States about the Action Plan once it is finalized. Dear Co Chairs, Dear Participants, Let me turn then to today's topic, Mandate delivery. Now, mandates set out the actions which Member States instruct the UN to undertake, and mandate delivery is how we carry out those mandated actions today. As you all know, our mandates are quite numerous, very varied. By way of example, your decisions and your resolutions provide for such things as the establishment of subsidiary organs of the General Assembly, ECOSOC or the Security Council, for reports of the Secretary General, for the holding of meetings or workshops on particular subjects, for the establishment of of a peace operation, or for the establishment of an envoy, for example, to undertake good offices, and a great deal else. So we can see the great variety of issues dealt with under mandates. Colleagues we currently have more than 400 intergovernmental bodies in New York, Geneva, Nairobi and Vienna alone. All of these bodies have their own agenda, meetings and documents. So let me give you a bit of an insight into some of the implications of your decisions in these areas. When Member States mandate the production of a report, for example, they should perhaps be aware that the costs related to to the issuance of an additional report in all six languages of 8,500 words amounts to US$24,500 at headquarters. This is just the cost of editing, translation and issuance of the document doesn't include the drafting, consultation and review of content. And in 2024 alone, 1/4 billion that's billion with a b words were translated by the Secretariat in New York, Geneva, Vienna and Nairobi. If Member States mandate the holding of a meeting, they might keep in mind that the cost of holding an additional two sessions at headquarters in all six official languages lasting up to three hours for each session, comes to $15,900 per day. This includes the costs related to interpretation and meeting services, but does not include the cost of substantive support by a Secretariat office or webcast services. And in 2024 alone, nearly 27,000 meetings were held again in New York, Geneva, Vienna and Nairobi. And if Member States choose to mandate the establishment of a peacekeeping operation or special political mission. Costs can range from around US$68 million per year for a small mission such as the UN Mission for the referendum in Western Sahara Minoso, with around 400 military and civilian personnel, to a large mission such as the UN Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Monusco, which costs almost a billion dollars per year and has over 13,000 personnel in all. Now this information perhaps gives you a sense of the breadth of what we are referring to, what we mean by mandate delivery and the significant implications that your decisions have in terms of financial and opportunity costs. And with that sort of introduction, let me turn to the key issues which are identified in the Secretary General's report in respect of mandate delivery. We believe that the report presents an objective, data driven analysis of our current situation and three basic concerns arise from this analysis. Firstly, the proliferation of meetings and reports. Secondly, the inadequate coordination in the distribution of tasks and responsibilities in the Secretariat for Mandate delivery and thirdly, misaligned funding modalities which can amplify challenges in the effective delivery of mandates. So a few comments from me on each of these three concerns with a view to help frame your deliberations in the Working Group on the question of meetings and reports. Quantitatively, over one in every ten dollars in the UN's regular budget is spent on direct costs associated with with meetings and reports, with indirect costs coming on top of that. Despite this I think remarkable output, most of these reports are not widely read. Last year more than half of reports were downloaded less than 2,000 times worldwide. Another example, the UN observes almost 250 international days and weeks every year, each of them established by a specific resolution, there is a significant time and cost resource cost both in negotiating and observing these international days and weeks. And whilst the General assembly decided in Resolution 79, 327 to pause the consideration of new proposals for international days, the fact remains that so many international days already vie for attention and that situation remains. No less than six international days have been proclaimed for 21 March alone. Co chairs Dear Participants, it is of course for you Member States to determine whether all of this represents the best use of both time and constrained financial resources, or whether there may be value in redirecting some of these resources to alternatives that might deliver greater impact. As you know, the Ad Hoc Working Group on the work of the General assembly has in recent years already taken steps towards streamlining the agenda of the assembly and improving the working methods of the main Committees. The Secretary General's report points to the option of such steps being taken further across various organs, Member States could consider prioritizing requests for reports and meetings, could combine requests for reports on similar themes, or could adjust the frequency or the format of reports. And if the Working Group is interested in examining this topic further, we of course stand ready to support you with analytics, including for example, a list of reports mandated to the Secretariat by topic and by periodicity, and that could perhaps help all of you to get a better insight into the volume and the types of report currently mandated. We have also committed to publishing download statistics for the reports we produce so that Member States can have full understanding of of the readership of the different reports, and we are working on an online tool to make that data accessible and to help to inform your work. Turning to the second concern, which relates to the management of mandate delivery, there is evidence that in the absence of appropriate management and coordination arrangements, too often individual UN entities work in isolation rather than seeking to ensure strategic alignment across the system to drive impact and efficiency in mandate delivery. The result is an unclear or a poor division of labour, which risks duplication that can generate waste and weaken impact. The Secretary General's report also points to the need to strengthen internal oversight to ensure a better division of labour across entities and stronger accountability for our performance. I would note also that proposals in the SG's recent report under UN 80 Work Stream 3 develop some aspects of this area and the thinking that we have upon it. Thirdly, and finally, the question of funding misalignment. Dear Participants, A great majority of UN funds comes from voluntary contributions and not from assessed contributions. Voluntary contributions were about 80% of total UN income in 2023, and this has important consequences for the ability of the UN to allocate resources optimally. Moreover, most voluntary funding is both earmarked and provided in small grants. In 2023, 85% of voluntary funding was earmarked and 60% of government grants were below US$1 million. All of this limits our ability to deploy resources where they are needed most and imposes high transaction costs. As already acknowledged in the discussions on the 2019 Funding Compact, pooled funds can enable more strategic and more cost efficient approaches for the work of the United nations as a whole, and we look forward to working with you to develop ideas on how to make pooled funding a more attractive option, a preferred option to overcome fragmented delivery that can result from fragmented funding Co Chairs, Distinguished Delegates to conclude, let me reiterate that my colleagues and myself are at your disposal to provide all additional support that you might consider helpful and appropriate. I have unfortunately to leave the meeting at this point I I have to return to the Chief Executive Board discussion but members of my team are with you there in the room and I look forward to finding out through them the readout of your deliberations today. And I look forward as well to continuing and resuming our dialogue on the 14th of November. Thank you very much for this opportunity.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you so much, Mr. Ryder. And we completely understand that you have to return to the ceb, but thank you for that presentation. I will now give the floor to His Excellency Christian Beneveso, Permanent Representative of Liechtenstein.

**LIE** | Christian Beneveso, Permanent Representative
Thank you so much to both of you and it's a pleasure to be here. Thank you for the invitation to talk about our experience in putting resolutions forward and on both on mandate design and and the implementation. We have over the past nine years put forward five resolutions in the General assembly in chronological order. The first in 2016, the creation of the so called IIM, the accountability mechanism for Syria. Then in the times of the lockdown. First the so called Laguna Group resolution and I'm pleased to see some of the members of the group in the room. That was a resolution on Solidarity in the times of COVID 19. Third again during the lockdown procedural decision on electronic voting in the channel assembly in 2021, a resolution on the situation in Myanmar and finally and maybe best known the Veto initiative in 2022. The first resolution on the IIIM obviously created a mandate. In fact it created an entity that is now located in Geneva and interestingly it did not at the time of the adoption create a pbi, even though that entity had has now an annual budget of about US$20 million. That happened for technical reasons that would be too lengthy to go into. But if somebody wants to take this up in the Q and A, I'll be happy to go a bit deeper on it. So this mechanism was first financed through voluntary contributions, then moved to the regular budget and today, for better or worse, it relies again heavily on voluntary contributions, but still still has a core funding from the regular budget. The COVID 19 solidarity resolution has been cited by parts of the UN system, did not create a mandate and did not mean to create a mandate. And I will not go deeper on this resolution, therefore, because we are talking about mandates here. The Myanmar resolution in 2021 was primarily a political resolution in the absence of of action in the Security Council advocating for action after the unconstitutional military seizure of power and again and actually intentionally did not create a mandate either, but was an impactful text nonetheless. The other two Texts are perhaps, from a mandate perspective, the most interesting ones. While they did not directly mandate specific activities, they did create overarching mandates that can be triggered and then also result in costs. The decision that we put forward during the pandemic, and for those who were not here, this was a time when obviously we were not able to meet in person. The General assembly continued its work, but. But because we were not able to meet in person, the view emerged that only resolutions that found consensus in the membership could be adopted. And we found that to be, with many others, an untenable situation for the Council to be subject to a permanent threat of veto de facto by one member of the organization. This is why the E voting procedure was introduced so today. If, for whatever reason we are not able to meet in the General assembly, we are nonetheless able to vote without being in the same room together. This is a mechanism that was technically complicated to develop and that was done certainly with the help from the Secretariat. And it has not since been used and triggered. If it were to be used, of course it would lead to costs in application, but it did not incur a PBI or had any sort of costing attached to it at the time of adoption. The veto initiative. And maybe good to read out the technical title of this resolution. It's called a standing mandate for the General assembly debate when a veto is cast in the Security Council. End of quote, end of title. So obviously this creates a mandate. But. It did not incur any cost because the costs only arise if and when the Channel assembly meets as a result of a veto. So that means the costs incurred are actually caused in the Security Council and through the veto cast in the Security Council. There was for this reason also no PBI and no costing attached to this, to this resolution, as for us, has become clear in discussion, one of the problems that we have is that sometimes it's unclear what counts as a mandate and what does not. For the resolutions. I have talked about our resolutions, we do believe that this is clear. While some people may question whether mandate is the correct term to describe the e voting procedure, we think it is. But maybe that is up for discussion. But I think one of the things that we certainly need to get clarity on is what is a mandate, what creates a mandate. And that should be a building block of how we move forward and mandate creation in other cases, and I'll use the triple IM here, it is clear that there is a mandate created and literally people working for a body laid out by a resolution. So in our view, the triple IM and the Veto initiative clearly create mandates, and I have already talked about E voting with respect to whether that is a mandate or not. For us, a key observation is that the strength of resolutions relied in our case very heavily on the extensive consultations we had with the relevant parts of the UN system, sometimes also with outside actors. That was the case to a very significant extent for the triple im, where we talked very extensively with the Commission of Inquiry established by the Office of the High Commissioner, the Office of the High Commissioner itself, and other parts of the UN system, but also with independent experts on international criminal law from the outside. Also, importantly, after the adoption of the mandate, we were part of the implementation, in particular in the discussions on the terms of reference with ohchr, and I really cannot overemphasize how important that is and how important that conversation is both at the phase of the creation of the mandate and thereafter. Similarly, for the E voting decision, we consulted very closely with the relevant parts of the Secretariat, in particular the jcm, on feasibility and technical modalities, and without the active support and the positive mindset from the Secretariat, we would not have been able to create this mechanism either. We also engaged very extensively with the Secretariat on technical and practical questions raised in the drafting of the veto initiative. One of the questions I think that are key here are fragmentation and maybe more importantly, duplication. If there are ways to address this issue from a terminological perspective using AI tool, that is great. But the tools we have do not yet, in our view, manage to do this, partly because mandates can be arrived at with many different terms, many different turns of phrase in a resolution. So we should, at the phase of drafting a mandate, again, I think, benefit in particular from the input from the Secretariat and to have an overview of what is already happening. One thing on mandate implementation that we can clearly do is to give guidance to the SG to determine who carries out what mandate. Part of the duplication appears to come from a reality today where departments look for mandates to implement. There is a bit of a place for that. But we do believe it is more important to have the SG use the discretion vested in his office, in her office, to give guidance to the system. And we think that is certainly key in avoiding duplication. And it's something we're drafters of resolutions, and those who have ownership over them can play a significant role. On a side note, I think worth noting that both the Myanmar and the veto initiative resolutions were aimed at the same goal, namely to have the GA act on issues of peace and security when the Council is unable to do so in line with the Charter's mandate. The GA of course does adopt many resolutions with mandates for peace and security, which we believe the Secretariat implements accordingly. With respect to the recent report of the sg, one resolution that comes up relatively often is of course the GA revitalization resolution which recommends shorter action oriented text, something that is clearly beneficial, and the introduction of expiration clauses where appropriate. This has double benefit of making mandates clearer so they can be delivered more effectively and reducing the amount of text being processed. On the issue of periodicity, again, I think a key aspect of our conversation certainly interesting and probably unusual, all the resolutions that we presented were one off resolutions, so none of them needed to be adopted again to be in force or to be or to have an impact. You know, we do not really have the capacity as a small state to put forward five resolutions a year and we're certainly very happy that we don't have to because otherwise that's how we would be spending our time. But that's not the main reason why we drafted the resolutions this way. We simply did not feel that it was necessary or in fact helpful, even though in context of a couple of them it was discussed. And I really want to encourage states to think about this when they present resolutions that the one off resolution certainly can be as meaningful, as impactful as other resolutions. As a minimum, I believe we should move away from this prevailing logic that the default position is that resolution is an annual resolution. I think that is clearly wrong. I see actually pretty much no reason for that. And there are at the end, if you look at everything together, it's probably a minority of resolutions where that is in fact justified. On a similar note, there is not per se a need to ask for NSG report every year. Again, I think there is a certain automaticity in how we think about this. You write a resolution, so obviously the last para you write is you request a report from the sg and that does not necessarily mean that you know why you want the report, except that that is the basis for the discussion that you have next year. So again, none of our resolutions did have a report and we don't think they're any less meaningful for that matter. Of course they are a bit sui generis, at least some of them. But again, I think it's extremely important to think about this and also to think about the proposal made by our colleague from Costa Rica here that perhaps at the beginning when you have a new mandate, it may be helpful to have an SG report that helps you frame the discussion. But that does not mean that you have to have a report every single year or at the very least you should ask for something more specific. A primary point that is rarely clear at the point of adoption is how much a resolution might cost in terms of budget. We think that as a matter of transparency, every resolution should be costed and that this should happen as a matter of course so we know how much we are spending. Last point on the interrelated nature of mandate creation, implementation and review. The tools we use to build a mandate are inextricably linked to the overall design of the mandate and the purpose for which we build it. So we should not separate these two things. And if you write a mandate, if you write a resolution, you should at the same time already think about the implementation. And again, that's why the dialogue with the Secretariat is so important. So in conclusion, just you know, the takeaways from our perspective, the first is a one off resolution can be fine. Some of the most famous resolutions that the General assembly in particular has adopted, of course were adopted one time only. And that maybe is something that is worth thinking about BE 26, 25, 3314 or many others. And at the very least we should look, and that's the second point, at the periodicity of a resolution on the basis of of the merits of the text at a time of creation, an SG report is not required to mandate action or in our view to make a resolution impactful. As a minimum, it should be understood that there is no automaticity in asking for NSG report. We should have an estimate of how much a resolution may cost, including if provisions are triggered by another body or or by a Member State later. In our case, that was the example given was the veto initiative. And certainly Member States should engage very extensively with the Secretariat on products and to achieve different purposes to improve the quality of the resolutions, but also of the mandates. To ensure that a mandate is well understood in the Secretariat and implement it accordingly and probably most importantly, to avoid duplication and to know what is already happening. And that may well be part of a mandate that you're about to create. And finally there is a responsibility for follow up and implementation with a view to ensuring that Secretariat has the assistance and the guidance needed to process a mandate as efficiently as possible. Thank you so much.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you, Christian. And I'll give the floor to Mr. Martin Kimani, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Africa center and former Permanent Representative of Kenya. It's good to see you, Martin.

**Africa Centre** | Martin Kimani, President & CEO
Good afternoon. Thank you very much for giving me the floor. Dear Chairs Excellencies and distinguished colleagues, I'm very glad to be participating in these important deliberations as we discuss gaps in mandates and implementation. Our sense of urgency must be sharpened by the atrocities unfolding in El Fascia, Sudan. Yesterday, the WHO condemned reports of killings and abduction of hundreds inside a maternity ward. The unfortunate reality is that human beings are impelled to make the most radical changes due to emergency. Such indeed was a necessity that impelled the creation of the un. The world is beset by emergency today, especially, as I've just mentioned, in Sudan and Gaza and here in headquarters, there is a budget crisis. We should use them to build the un. The world needs. As you know, the reality of being a permanent representative or a delegate here is that one is constantly busy and yet finds that business quite frustrating. Many times during the day you sit in the machinery that is built to maintain peace and protect life, yet you see it falter repeatedly in real time. That helplessness is not abstract to me. It was my daily experience, including during Kenya's term on the Security Council a few years ago. We increased our staff, had two substantive DPRs at ambassador level, and our experts tried to be present across the system. Yet we still worked seven days a week from early morning into the night. And while I am proud of our work, so much was left undone due to the weaknesses of the implementation system here. My focus today, however, goes beyond the time constraints of delegations to the role of knowledge in implementation, especially across the peace and development nexus. While I served as the president of one of the executive boards, I used to quip quite often that the UN is the world's most knowledgeable organization. But its inability to effectively manage knowledge means that its workers seldom have what they need at the moment of decision. It knows a lot, but it doesn't know what it knows. An American study of knowledge workers found that they spend nearly a fifth of their time searching for information. With thousands of meetings, overlapping mandates and siloed repositories, the figure at the UN is likely to be higher. This is a direct financial and effectiveness tax on implementation. We face three linked weak points or failures. First is information asymmetry. Agencies and departments meet, learn and decide in isolation. Insights stay where they are produced and entities cite the same mandates without a shared implementation picture. Second is search inefficiency. Staff spend a large share of time hunting across unconnected systems. Time that should fund analysis and delivery is consumed by retrieval. Included in this are delegations with their oversight function, which is consequently weakened. Third, we suffer knowledge loss at scale rotation in Peace operations and turnover in country teams drain institutional memory. When countries move from peacekeeping to peace building, they often build initiatives such as community policing from scratch. Despite the UN's years of mission experience that should contribute to that task. The knowledge exists here, but it's too often inaccessible. There have been attempts to change this before, of course. There have been lessons learned. Units launched knowledge networks and individual agencies have built repositories. But most have underperformed for three reasons. They were siloed by entity under resourced aside projects rather than core infrastructure, and had no accountability for usage or contribution. What is different now is technology and of course, the emergency that we are facing. For instance, artificial intelligence can search across silos. It can surface patterns and cut retrieval time by orders of magnitude. Recent advances in Australia, for instance, demonstrate how institutions are experimenting with multimodal AI systems to deploy autonomous digital workers that perform entire workflows. These AI systems are being tested to manage routine back office functions, freeing human staff for analysis, judgment and partnership building. Early evidence suggests substantial productivity gains and error reduction when standardized processes are automated, provided that oversight and ethical safeguards remain strong. The relevance to the work of the UN is clear. Much of its administrative and reporting work is repeatable and rule based, while implementation decisions are human and contextual. A similar division of labor could release significant capacity across the system. Machines handle structured workflows. People focus on diplomacy, negotiation and learning. The goal here is augmentation, not to just replace UN staff. The question is whether we have the discipline to deploy it with clear governance and joint ownership. I very much recall talking to different executive directors about the data flows and asking them if they could pool knowledge information in one data pool. And of course all of them, because I was president of the board that year, were very welcoming of my remarks, but they went nowhere with it. So I propose three integrated moves. Each addresses a past weak point and I think together they can change how we deliver. The first is to build country knowledge infrastructure with joint ownership. So in every nexus context on peace and development established an index repository that surfaces conflict analysis, the political economy program evidence, human rights reporting and financing data to all UN actors and key partners. And this of course can build on already the reforms and the existence of the resident coordinator working with mission leadership to ensure that no single entity controls access or content standards. That infrastructure should include an AI enabled layer that allows queries across resolutions, SG reports, evaluations and lessons databases. A practitioner should be able to ask what worked for demobilization in a context like theirs and receive some form of design elements, contact details for implementers and ready to use indicators within minutes. Let's make usage visible in senior compacts. If a product is not discoverable through this system, do not ask the field to produce it. Assign executive ownership at the ASG level, perhaps in each entity to ensure that this is core business, not a side project. 2. We need to link tacit knowledge to accountability structures. Tacit knowledge is how so much of the great work in this organization is done. It travels through people. So we should establish more practitioner networks that connect peace operations, special political missions, resident coordinator offices and humanitarian workers. Let's name nexus coordinators with dual reporting to the resident coordinators and mission leads. Let's give them shared indicators, e.g. sustained reduction in violence incidents around key project areas and time to transition to specific services from mission to national systems. Let's have budget lines that must acknowledge nexus work even if they're not joint budget lines. 3. Let's rationalize reporting and measure knowledge use. As Christian was saying, we can replace bundles of low use reports with consolidated decision briefs in each context. We can track open rates, references in decisions and follow through. We can percentage of new programs at site and apply evaluation lessons and share of joint analysis actually used at decision points. We can track all these. We really. You know I have to say that I was really struck when I visited N. Nigeria to go to the Northeast and see the development and peace building work that was done. And I felt the power of the tacit knowledge that was there. The depth of communication between the UN system and the national authorities and the decision making participation by the national authorities in operations in the Northeast showed the UN at its best. I am pretty much convinced that after the movement of those UN staff that instituted that that the new ones had to learn all those lessons all over again. It's too expensive. Centralizing knowledge raises legitimate concerns about sensitive information. Let's keep the systems that I'm proposing on secure UN infrastructure. Default access should be here to the UN and delegations and and pre agreed partners such as the African Union. Let's restrict sensitive material through role based permissions that are managed and lets member states receive consolidated products, not raw field analysis. We want our technology to produce productivity, not be an intelligence gathering exercise. And you can establish a small interagency board to set standards and resolve access disputes. And of course you have to protect sources while making inclusion the operating principle. As I come to a close, we all know that most of the nexus contexts are in Africa. I think that is an opportunity to use that concentration of effort to lead the agenda. Let's establish an Africa Nexus knowledge hub that connects AU structures, regional economic communities and UN teams. In a first regional pilot of this approach, let's build regional learning networks around shared problems such as cross border transhumans or urban violence. For a field team, less time searching, more time tailoring. When a mission planner rotates out, successors will inherit a living record of their decisions, why they were taken, and what they achieved. For you member states, it comes up with fewer, better products that synthesize across organs and entities and allow smaller delegations to enter debates with the same factual base as the larger ones. But of course, knowledge management is not a substitute for political will, adequate resources or clear mandates. Christian spoke deeply and knowledgeably about that. It cannot resolve policy agreements among Member States. It cannot make up for chronic underfunding. What it can do is ensure that we have agreement and resources and we do not waste them relearning what we already know. The best knowledge systems fail without the right people to use them. We must hire for both excellence and inclusion. Excellence means recruiting staff with the technical skills, contextual knowledge and judgment. Inclusion means drawing that talent from the broadest possible pool, particularly from the regions where we work. A country team without nationals in senior roles will miss context that determines whether programs succeed or fail. I am constantly approached by young people and professionals who want to work for the un. People who I find utterly brilliant. And I find many UN staff utterly brilliant. But I have to say it seems like a rigged game where a lot of people who have the qualifications that would uplift this organization are just not given the chance. If that doesn't happen, it doesn't matter how much knowledge management you put in the system. The whole system will not work. Geographic and gender balance are key to operational effectiveness. So let me close by just finishing by noting the obvious. Our problem is not lack of knowledge. It is really how to build systems that harness that knowledge, direct it and allow access to it. Humanity and countries and states and philanthropists, so many have contributed many billions of dollars to the work of the un. The collected knowledge and expertise is humanity's great prize, not only for the work of the un, but all those civil society organizations that would like access to the same information subject to reasonable limits. Thank you so much for giving me the chance to contribute to this debate. And I wish all of you all the best in delivering to us the United nations that we so solely need. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you so much Martin, for that intervention. It was almost as if you never left us. I now give the floor to Mr. Meera Haq former UN Under Secretary General for the Department of Field Support, former co Chair of the High Level Independent Panel on Peace Operations, former Secretary General, Special Representative for Timor Lester, and head of the UN Integrated Mission Initiative, East Timor. Ms. Hack, you have the floor and welcome.

**UN Secretariat** | Meera Haq, Former USG DFS
Thank you very much. I will try to go through very quickly, but first just want to say that all protocols observed I have had a career in the United nations. My career spanned 40 years. Of that 40 years, I spent 21 years in the field where the implementation was taking place in many countries. But I spent 19 years, obviously in headquarters where I think it was also very important to get the perspective of the political frameworks, policy frameworks and other things that go into mandate creation and implementation that many of the speakers have have touched on this morning. I also feel very fortunate because in the course of my career in the UN I had the opportunity to work in all three specific areas of the un, namely in development, in humanitarian and in the peace and security sectors. So, you know, and I've looked at implementation in all of these areas. I retired 10 years ago and obviously once you're retired you have time to reflect and very often I do. And I Wonder Whether my 40 years, you know, made an impact because sometimes when I see where the world is, particularly countries that I worked in, you know, the crisis situations that they are still in, as the earlier speaker referred to in, in Sudan, you know, you have to sit back and wonder, you know, what, what is it that we did? Did we do everything, you know, correctly? Is there something that we could have done better? So I hope today in talking to you, I'll be able to reflect some of that in the context of what you're discussing, which is so important in terms of the UN at 80 years. So let me start by speaking of the development work, because I spent of the 40 years, I spent 20 years in development primarily with UNDP. And let me say that in 1976, when I started my career, it was in Jakarta, Indonesia. And I remember going to the UNDP office and I was ushered into a meeting with the UN DP in Jakarta and the resident representative there introduced me. And then he went on to introduce everyone else who was sitting around the table. And he introduced me to someone who he said was the senior agricultural advisor and that was the representative from fao. And then sitting next to him was the senior industrial advisor and that was the representative from unido, and then there was the UN Population advisor who was the representative of the UN FPA and so on. We all worked in the Same building in Jakarta. There were two agencies, the ILO and the and UNESCO, that had their own offices and country representatives, but those representatives were also in that. In that meeting. And UNDP at the time was the central funding agency. And the meetings that we had there was very much anchored in national ownership of the UN program. And we worked with the Indonesian Planning Agency with their national development plan to see how the UN could intervene and work with the government on certain aspects of the plan. So it was the discussions were, you know, how much should go into agriculture, how much should go into, you know, manpower and, you know, setting up social safety nets in terms of Social Security administration, how much should we be supporting the national census that was going to be built there? It all came under one funding. But I should also tell you that in the two years that I was in Indonesia, in the course of those two years, the senior agricultural advisor of FAO became the FAO country representative, and FAO set up a separate representation outside of those premises. The same happened with unido, the same happened with unfpa. So this fragmentation that Guy Rider talked about, I witnessed that in the course. And part of what I, you know, what I want to call attention to is that many countries then, you know, that central pooled funding or the central funding that was there for the country program of Indonesia got broken up and fragmented into direct funding to the agency programs. And so, you know, when I read some of the documents, what I think of is that we're trying to go back to the future to what it was, because it was one UN sitting around the table working with national authorities, you know, in sort of supporting their development plan. Now, the UN and I have been resident coordinator in four countries, was that I feel I spent a lot of time as resident coordinator and as resident representative of the UN in mobilizing resources because I think development has been chronically underfunded. And the mandates that we get for development, whether it's the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals or earlier Millennium Development Goals or other mandates that we've had, remain underfunded. And so a great deal of my time was spent in mobilizing resources and as Resident coordinator, not only mobilizing resources for the undp, but for the UN country team as well. And there's also the, you know, we come with the technical agencies of the un. We come with, you know, technical assistance programs and projects. But sometimes we don't get that seat at the table because the larger financial institutes, IFIs, world banks, regional development banks, they come with massive investment in the sector and so very often the ministries of finance in those other countries are more interested obviously in looking at these huge investments that come into these sectors. So a lot of development work seems to suffer because of that. In moving to the humanitarian side, I would say that the humanitarian side of the UN in my experience, has been the side that delivers the best it may be. And I think it is largely so that in humanitarian work the mandate is saving lives. And in times of critical situations, there is very little that holds back, even though humanitarian appeals are never fully funded. But nevertheless, the mission of saving lives brings more to the table than a long term development goal. For instance. And in the humanitarian sector, I have seen that the interagency standing committee works well. The cluster system of the humanitarian system, where there's a lead agency, other agencies follow support, you know, that that works well as, and bringing in the non governmental and outside workers. So that part of the system I think is the one. But as I say, their mandate is very strong in terms of these are life saving actions that must be done. But I think the UN has worked out its mechanics well in this sector. Let me move then to the final sector where I spent the last 10 years of my career, which was in peace operations. And there I worked both in political and peacekeeping missions. In Afghanistan it was working in a political mission where the troops were NATO troops, but in Sudan we had our own UN troops. And in Timor Leste it was primarily a policing mission with the UN police contingent working very closely with other bilateral inputs as well. And where the UN had executive authority going back to Afghanistan immediately in the aftermath of 9 11, when the Karzai government was installed, it was very important for civil servants to be paid. And again, this goes a little bit into that. You know, what do you do as quick wins and the flexibility that is required for implementation under those circumstances. And at that time, a brilliant boss that I had, Julia Taft, who worked in the Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery, said, we have civil servants. And, you know, we sort of went through all kinds of, you know, discussions, but we were able to sort of make a real headway in saying, okay, we are going to deliver to every single civil servant in Afghanistan their first monthly salary. So In January of 2002, in brown paper bags, cash was given to every single civil servant of Afghanistan that stayed, that remained as a kind of one off. And this is where I think, you know, Ambassador Kimani was saying, the knowledge that we have, sometimes it is not used. You know, the flexibility that we had there, as I understand, didn't work in Aceh when the money was there, but the money couldn't go to those who desperately needed it at the time. So I think these kinds of flexibility in implementation is what is needed with the peace, whether it's political or peacekeeping missions. Again, I think both Ambassador Kimani and others referred to it that when the mandates are set up, it's very important to recognize that there is expertise that already resides within the UN system in the country for a long time. And so when I went to East Timor, for example, and we saw, you know, I had large numbers of staff who were experts on injustice and protection of civilians in, you know, domestic violence. Since that was quite a big issue in East Timor, you know, we were able to again in the context of East Timor, move that expertise to be embedded with the country team to provide the capacity that was needed to the institutions in East Timor, to the respective ministries and others in East Timor now. And at the time that the mission was closing, we also had to do quite a lot of groundbreaking work to say let's pass on some of these resources to the country team. And here one of the co chairs, New Zealand, knows very well how much we work to try and get community policing to continue so that when the mission stopped, that work didn't stop, but continued through the country team and continued through bilateral partners. So these things should not be anomalies. These things should be the norm. And as people have said, the knowledge exists there. The, you know, we need to take these lessons learned. We need to see how we can bring the system together. And you know, in, in many cases it's been demonstrated that, that it can be done. Lastly, on exit strategy, I'm a firm believer of that. It was very much a part of the HIPPO report recommendations as well. But this goes for just not within the peace and security sector, but everywhere. The, that whatever you do is finite. It's not sort of open ended and never ending. And so I think it's very important that the accountabilities are set in to have an exit strategy, to have a review structure and the accountability structure to see if things are being met and when you sort of make a plan to end it. And I always tell people that in my UN career I really felt that I was one of the most fortunate UN officials because what I, you know, and a ceremony that I was part of remains, you know, ingrained in me. When we lowered the flag of the UN and we raised the flag of Timor Leste and handed over the responsibility, closed the mission and handed over the responsibility of the police to the Timorese authorities. And the UN was able to say, you know, we've closed our mission successfully. That rarely happens in the un. So I feel very privileged that I was part of that. But I think it can. So, you know, I just want to close by saying that some of these things, I mean, people have spoken about it. I think people can ask more questions if they want, but I think there's quite a bit of experience, quite a bit of groundbreaking work that has been done. The key is how we can get back to some good practices that we had that brought the system together, that recognized where expertise was and matched the resources to where the expertise could best deliver on the ground. And finally to realize when it's time to say, you know, we need to leave. Thank you very much.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you very much, Ms. Hack, and not only for your presentation today, but for your decades of excellent service to this organization. I'll now open the floor for any questions from delegations on this technical briefing. Delegations are reminded that this technical briefing is to be followed by informal consultations at which there will be an opportunity for delegations to deliver statements. As we have been asked by you to be mindful of the overlap with meetings of the main committees, please don't make statements today. Time limits for your questions and comments to the panelists will therefore be limited. We are asking you to keep within a minute and a half. I will now give the floor to Costa Rica, to be followed by China.

**CRI**, Representative
Good afternoon. I would like first to thank the. Co facilitators for organizing this session on mandate implementation and to the speakers for their valuable insights. Christian, allow me to recognize your leadership. On a number of important initiatives. Their implementation has made this organization stronger. And empower the General assembly to act. At all times, even in the face of a pandemic, and particularly in matters. Of peace and security. And Martin, as you notice, excellence must. Be our North Star. The UN can only excel if we hire the best and if member states bring their best. Let me pose to questions. The Secretary General's report notes the oversight. Of mandates across the UN system is. Limited mostly to planning, budgeting and individual entity operationalization. If you could implement one measure to. Improve impact and efficiency across the system, what would it be? Second, what drives so many entities to. Spread themselves so thin across too many mandates? Is it primarily competition for resources? What a larger share of assessed rather than voluntary funding help entities focus on deliver more effectively? I thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Costa Rica. I give the floor now to China, to be followed by Ireland.

**CHN**, Representative
Thank you, Co Chairs. Thank you for organizing today's briefing. We have listened attentively and in light of the recommendations of the SGE report, we have two questions. The first one is regarding reports. What is the conversion rate between the recommendations in UN report and subsequent actions taken by Member States? What are the characteristics of the reports that have higher utilization rate among Member States? In terms of streamlining reports? What measures can the Secretariat take? And the second one is regarding to the meetings. The SG's report notes that both the establishment and the closure of bodies increase the Secretariat's workload. What are the characteristics of the more than 50 bodies that have been discontinued over the past decades? What are the steps can the Secretariat take to make full use of the existing resources and to avoid frequently established and closure of the bodies? Thanks.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the representative of China. I give the floor now to the representative of Ireland to be followed by Mexico.

**IRL**, Representative
Thank you very much, co facilitators. And thank you to all of our briefers for really excellent oversight overview of the various issues that we are dealing with in terms of mandate delivery. So very useful. The last briefing session we spoke about the lessons from the 2008 mandate creation in 2018. As the mandate report showed, there were a number of efforts towards UN reform in 2018 on the development system in particular. And a lot is flowing through into the report and into our presentations here today. And I guess it's a very general question, but what are the incentives and the disincentives that have driven success in those 2018 reforms and that have actually held back on progress in many of those 2018 reforms because they speak to the same issues. Revitalized and empowered resident coordinator system, new generation of country teams implementing mandates at the regional level in a revamped way. A funding compact which brings less fragmentation, more core funding. Many of the elements that we've spoken. About were in those reform efforts and. Yet they haven't reached the destination that perhaps we can get to. So looking at what might be holding them back and how we can drive them forward will be very critical in this exercise. And actually, final point, there was an evaluation of key elements of the UN Development system reform published just this July by the sector wide Evaluation Office. And that's a resource that we as a group would be very well advised to read through and understand because it might help us in terms of how the mandate creation and delivery system can work more effectively, including at the country level.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you very much. I thank the distinguished representative of Ireland. I give the floor now to Mexico to be followed by Cuba.

**MEX**, Representative
Thank you very much. And I would like to pose three questions. First, one, on proliferation of meetings and reporting, the report suggests rationalizing both the number and the length of meetings and reports and adopting differentiated formats. So we would like to know what strategic criteria should guide decisions on which reports are produced and which are consolidated to ensure that rationalization does not compromise accountability or Member States engagement. On the issue of inadequate mandate implementation, we would like to know. The report suggests making better use of system wide coordination platforms. So how can the Secretariat incentivize effective interagency collaboration with through these platforms? And what indicators could be used to measure whether this coordination reduces duplication and enhances efficiency? And lastly, on misaligned financing modalities, the report recommends fully implementing the commitments of the funding Compact and increasing flexibility in resource relocation. So what structural or governance obstacles could impede effective implementation of these measures and how might they be addressed to improve efficiency and impact at the country level? Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank Mexico. I give the floor now to Cuba, followed by the Russian Federation.

**CUB**, Representative
Thank you, facilitators. I would like to thank to you to the facilitators and the panelists for their briefings and express our full solidarity to the countries impacted by the hurried. Melissa. I would like to make three questions regarding the proposal to prioritize and simplify requests for reports or meetings. How will it be determined which report takes priority over another? Who will determine this and under what parameters? In line with this question, how it is expected to reduce the number of words in reports, particularly on issues that have been pending for many years, without undermining the priorities of the penholders of the resolution that creates the mandates? Finally, regarding the recommendation to grant United nations entities greater flexibility to redeploy resources with reasonable justification, we would like to know what is meant by reasonable justification and who will define it. How can this proposal be understood in light of the fact that the budget responds to a program plan defined by the Member States?

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you so much. Thank the representative of Cuba. Give the floor to the Russian Federation followed by Chile.

**RUS**, Representative
Thank you very much. So I have a question to the Secretariat. What are the mechanisms? Whether you have mechanisms in place that. Might ensure that consolidation or shortening of reports does not weaken in depth analysis or create methodological gaps or reduce traceability of decisions? Second question, to redeployment of resources. I think a lot of delegations touched upon this idea. So the idea to allow quicker deployment of resources to protect delivery, whether it poses risks, creating de facto prioritization of activities that originate with voluntary earmark funding versus those which originate from assessed contribution funding? And I also note that Mr. Guy Ryder touched upon the volumes of the voluntary contributions being the basis for the work of the Secretariat of the UN system. How can we ensure that the activities launched with extra budgetary resources is properly monitored by all the UN Member states and will not be prioritized or included into assets budgets later without an explicit GA decision? And last but not the least, my question goes to the co Chairs. I would like to thank them for bringing us the wisdom of Mr. Kimani. We're also happy to see him. But we're puzzled to understand why did you choose one PR for a Member state view? With all due respect to Our distinguished ambassador, Mr. Vinavisar, why did you choose him who devoted most of his speech speaking about mandates and decisions which hit the blow to unity of the un? Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you, Representative of the Russian Federation. I give the floor now to Chile, followed by the European Union.

**CHL**, Representative
Thank you Co Chairs for organizing this comprehensive briefing and to the speakers for sharing their valuable observations, insights and experiences with us. I would like to address one brief. Question to the representatives of the Secretariat. Based on the presentation by USG Guy Rider, the report shows that the length of the resolutions has grown considerably over the past two decades. We also heard about the costs of producing a 8,500 word report. Has any analysis been carried out to understand the factors driving this increase? And what exactly accounts for the additional thousands of words on average in each resolution in 2025 compared to 20, excuse me, 2005. Thank. You.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the representative of Chile. I give the floor now to the European Union followed by Malawi.

**EU**, Representative
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Co Chair. Thank you, Co Chairs. This is a very inspiring afternoon. I should say in particular also the very concrete contributions by Ambassador Vena Visa and Ambassador Kumani. Thank you. Thank you very much for that. I actually echo a little bit the questions by my dear colleague from Mexico on the use of the existing system wide coordination mechanisms and how can we use those, for example, but also the. UN Sustainable Development Group or the Interagency Standing Committee to improve coherent mandate implementation. Of course at country level we have the RC system, but more at the overall level here in New York and elsewhere. And the second question I have, and. I'm exposing my ignorance here, is when a mandate is adopted in a resolution. For example by the ga, who then. Decides within the Secretariat or within the system here, which part of the system. Will be sort of the owner of that mandate and gets to implement it. And last, but not least, as I. Said, following the Mexican question on the. Reports, what are the steps and the operational staffing and budgetary implications of combining reports? And is it possible to give an. Overview of. What would happen if we merge reports? And I recall that Guy Rider offered to produce a list of reports by topic and by periodicity, and maybe that's. Helpful to look into that as well. Thank you very much. I thank the European Union.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I give the floor to Malawi and then El Salvador. Thank you.

**MWI**, Representative
Thank you Co Chairs for your presentations and all the presenters for their insights on the UN 80 initiative. My delegation noted during the UNGA 80 that the UN some of the concerns that were expressed was that the UN has moved away from its basic mandate and therefore has not been efficient and effective. So first, how will the UN initiative ensure that the UN mandate is brought back to basics? And second, how will the review of the implementation of the UN mandate ensure that the UN work has impact on our people on the ground? Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Malawi. I give the floor now to El Salvador and then South Africa.

**SLV**, Representative
Thank you, Excellency. We wish to express our appreciation to the Co Chairs for committing this meeting and to the Undersecretary General Ryder and all the briefers for their valuable contributions to this session. Taking into account the information provided and the content of the ESG report, my delegation wishes to formulate the following questions. Paragraph 43 and 52 of the report refers to risk of duplications in the implementation of mandates, possible functional overlap and potential fragmentation and competition for use of resources, resources which will encourage the adoption of more opportunistic and less strategic approaches in each of the entities? In this regard, has the Secretariat identified a sense of competition for resources between agencies within the system? Are there any considerations regarding these cases in the field based for instance, or on the findings of the multiple QCPR reports during the last few years? In this Recommendation, in paragraph 52.2, the Secretary General suggests there is need to allow UN system entities greater flexibility to resources quickly with reasonable justification, including to protect essential country level delivery from funding cuts. In this regard, what will flexibility entails in this particular context? How can we provide flexibility without compromising accountability? And finally, with reference to the report and the discussion regarding the request for combined and reporting, the periodicity and other related elements, has there been any consideration of realistic alternatives that take into account the distinct functions, timelines and working approaches of the entities based in Vienna, in Geneva, as well as their relationship with the reports requested by the main Committees of the General assembly and the Subsidiary bodies of ecosoc thank you so much.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the representative of El Salvador. I give the floor now to South Africa, followed by Kenya and then finally Singapore.

**ZAF**, Representative
Thank you co chairs and just to say once again we appreciate these discovery sessions and further thank the four presenters for their extremely useful perspectives. And Ms. Hug, the examples that you gave really just gave us a good sense and a good feel of what can go wrong or right at the at a country level. Coming to the report of the sg, we support the proposed solutions for shorter reports, combining reports on similar issues and introducing different formats to address proliferation of meetings and reports. But we have some questions and I think Mexico and others have asked the same questions as to who will prioritize and streamline requests in mandates for reports and meetings. Will this task be allocated to the Secretariat and what objective criteria will be used to make this determination of prioritizing and streamlining and maybe should this has not been dealt with at the very beginning during the process of mandate design. Then on the matter of inadequate delivery, management and coordination we do agree that and support the need to strengthen internal strategic oversight and for mandate citations in programs and budget. But when we looked at the examples that have been given system wide coordination platforms, all the mechanisms that are in there in the report are internal and we are wondering if it will not save the system for coordination and avoidance of duplication to also make use of other independent units that we already have in the system like the Joint Inspection Unit or the Member State oversight body such as the Committee for Program and Coordination, the cpc. So looking at independent bodies as part of that system wide thing, then on the misaligned funding modalities that entrenches fragmentation, one of the in the report itself, one of the recommendation there was that the outcome of UNAD pillar 3 is going to assist and we fully agree with that and therefore say we need to look at how we deal with that pillar three carefully because then it's going to help us in dealing with this particular challenge of misaligned finding modalities that entrenches fragmentation. Then lastly, Resolution 79327 on the revitalization of the GA, the work of the GA was mentioned a couple of times and it had a whole section on working methods and some of the recommendations that are there in the report, some of the issues that have been raised are also addressed in that resolution. So we are wondering if maybe that can be lifted and can be demonstrated how do we further integrate again so that you don't you know that resolution is nowhere there and this UNAIDS over here, how do we integrate and show interconnectedness between the outcomes of that resolution and what we are trying to do here?

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you very much. I thank the distinguished representative of South Africa. Give the floor now to Kenya and then our last intervener will be Singapore.

**KEN**, Representative
Thank you, co chairs. I also wish to take this opportunity to appreciate all the briefers more. So it's always good listening to brother Ambassador Martin Kimani. The ongoing review under the work stream too offers an opportunity to address challenges. Of fragmentation, underfunding and limited accountability while. Reinforcing coherence across the UN security system. In this regard then, I wish to place about two questions. One, on financing, how will the reforms. Ensure that newly approved or renewed mandates are matched with predictable, sustainable and adequate financing to avoid persistent implementation gaps? Two, on coherence and efficiency, what mechanisms will be introduced to reduce duplication and fragmentation among entities delivering similar mandates? And lastly on accountability and performance, what. Result based metrics or performance frameworks will be adopted to monitor progress, measure impact and ensure that mandate implementation is effectively evaluated beyond financial compliance? I thank you. I thank the distinguished representative of Kenya. I give the floor now to Singapore, followed by Argentina. Thank you very much, coaches. This has been a very useful discussion and I thank the presenters, the panelists for their perspectives.

**SGP**, Representative
I think each one of us has tabled resolutions as our national initiatives and our national contribution to the work of the un. So each one of us has an interest in the issue of implementation. And naturally each one of us will have a different perspective. But if we do not collectively agree on some ways to reduce the number of reports, the length of reports and the number of meetings, and the length of meetings, then we would all have collectively failed. 1,100 reports a year plus 27,000 meetings a year is simply overwhelming for many small delegations, including mine. So that is the perspective from which we are approaching this. Not with a view to prioritizing or deprioritizing certain issues, but how do we collectively find a way to make our work more effective? So here I have three questions. First, with regard to annual reports, About 60% of the annual reports recur, or rather reports recur 60% of them. My question is, to what extent are these reports almost identical? In other words, if a report is produced with very little substantial changes or modifications, you know, there must be a way of measuring that. So if it's largely identical, how many percentage of that 60% of reports that recur? I mean, if some estimation of that I think will be useful for us to give a sense as to whether we need an annual update that is largely identical. So that's where we can go into differentiated formats. Maybe a two page executive summary update of a previous annual report. So that's the first set of question. Second question relates to a request for a report. How many instances are there or how often is it the case that a request for report leads to a duplication of reports within the UN system? So we request the SG for a report, but that could also prompt a series of agencies to also produce their own report. And that I think is not a very helpful situation because when we make a request to the sg, we want to see a coherent coordinated report from the UN system, not a series of reports. And but I want to get some data as to whether this is a big issue of duplication or multiplicity of reports on a specific question when there is a request. I think if some data can be shared with us that would be useful. Then the third question comment relates to the question of issue of downloaded reports. I mean there were some statistics about, you know, some that are downloaded more than others. Yes, I agree that more downloads does not make it more important an issue. But I think still some data will be useful for me and my delegation to know what are the thematic issues on which there's greater downloading as opposed to other issues. Because if a report is not downloaded very often, not that we do away with the report, but we need to examine why are those requests being made, say for an important issue but nobody's reading them, then something's wrong with us. If we are producing reports that are important and no one's reading them, I mean that's a serious issue that we need to collectively address. But I think as a starting point we need also some data we could use. And I guess the final point I want to make is more an observation. Very good to see you Martin. I think very interesting presentation that you made. I think this is an issue that I think we have discussed for some time. The only glimmer of hope I sense is that with AI as a tool, hopefully we know what we know and hopefully we know where to look for what we do not know. But AI is not the solution in its entirety, but it can be a very important tool. So that gives me some hope. But my question though is to what extent is the UN designed to utilize AI as a tool for information or knowledge management as you put it? I mean this is a large question, but the question is what do we need to do as the UN to make it future ready that's a very broad question for reflection. Thank you very much to the co chairs and all the panelists.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Singapore. Give the floor now to Argentina and then to close us out, the United States. Thank you, Ambassador.

**ARG**, Representative
Thank you to all the panelists. I have one specific question and it's about one of the proposed solutions that the reports provide regarding I would say the fragmentation or duplication and it's number two when it says ensure UN entities review mandate citations in their programs and budgets so that entities only cite mandates for which they have demonstrable comparative advantage. So maybe if in a later stage chair, we could have maybe more insights on how those manned citations are done within the Secretary, but also the role of Member states. I know that the CPC might have a role to play there, but maybe there are other instances where we can address this issue more in deep and maybe the answers will help us to have a also proposal for next meeting. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the representative of Argentina. I give the floor now to the representative of the United States.

**USA**, Representative
Thanks so much, Ambassador. And I realize I'm last and came. In late, so I'll try to be. Quick, but I wanted to make a connection to something that we were speaking about in the last session when we were looking at mandate creation. And I think much of the discussion on reports sort of bridges both that discussion and this discussion. One caveat. I think at times the metric of how often a report gets downloaded can be a bit misleading because there are a number of very technical meetings, often with a small number of delegates who need that report to inform their deliberations. For example, I am going to guess that very few Fifth Committee reports get read outside of the Fifth Committee, and yet they're essential to to the work of the fifth committee. So the downloading of 2,000 reports as a metric might be a misnomer, but I do think the quality of the reports is critical and I want to compliment the Executive Office of the Secretary General for the quality of the reports that have been provided to us on UN80. I think both the analysis, but even more importantly the way that data is presented, the use of visuals, tables, graphs that I think are light years above the sort of standard quality of information presentation that we receive in most UN reports. And my question then, and this is not something that needs to be answered now by any means, but what is the obstacle to bringing the quality of data presentation that that we're Getting in the UN 80 reports to all of the rest of reports that we use across the various committees and bodies of the un. Thanks. I thank the representative of the United States.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
That brings us to the last speaker for today. In light of the time we had promised to keep these tight, we will provide written answers in as much as we can do so ahead of the consultations which will take place on the 14th of November. And we look forward to seeing you all there. Thank you for your presence today. Thank you to our briefers, our panelists, and to all of you at the the Secretariat team for providing the space as well. Thank you so much. The meeting is adjourned.

## Session 5: Review and Assessment (Nov 14 Part 1, 2025)
Video: /video/k1j/k1jax5ye21

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
Good morning. Good morning, colleagues. May I invite you to take your seats? It. Good morning. I call to order the informal meeting of the Working Group for consultations on the matter of mandate implementation. On behalf of Ambassador Schwarger, I warmly welcome all of you to today's consultations on mandate implementation under the ongoing UNAT review process. We begin by recognizing the presence of Mr. Guy Ryder, under Secretary General for Policy and chair of the UN 80 task force his Excellency Christian Venavesso, Permanent representative of Liechtenstein Mr. Martin Kimani, President and Chief Executive Officer of the African center and former Permanent Representative of Kenya and who is joining us virtually along with Mr. Meera Haq, former United Nations Under Secretary General for the Department of Field Support, former co Chair of the High Level Independent Panel on Peace Operations and former Secretary General Special Representative for Timor Lest and Head of the United Nations Integrated Mission in East Timor. The objective of this session is to collectively reflect on the insights and recommendations emerging from the Mandate implementation briefing on 30 October and to identify concrete next step that can enhance efficiency, transparency and accountability in how mandates are implemented across the United nations system. We welcome views on the recommendations made on mandate implementation in the Secretary General's report, as well as any additional proposals Working Group members may wish to put forward themselves. We aim to foster a shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities inherent in mandate implementation, strengthen coordination among entities and ensure that our collective efforts are guided by the principles of effectiveness, inclusivity and results oriented delivery in support of the organization's overarching goals. In this vein, we wish to reassure Member States that we have taken careful note of the valuable recommendations provided to the Working Group thus far. We reiterate the importance of maintaining a collaborative and inclusive approach with the full engagement of all Member States to ensure a process that is both effective and transparent. Our shared objective remains to achieve the highest possible level of ambition. By the conclusion of this exercise, we aim to inspire fresh, pragmatic and innovative thinking that strengthens the culture of mandate design and implementation across the United nations system. As we continue our engagement in this discovery phase, we hope to deepen our collective understanding of mandates, guided by empirical evidence, analytical insights and lessons drawn from best practices across the United nations system. There appear to be some emerging areas of common interest that we have discerned from the consultations and discussions to date. It is our intention to elaborate on those when we provide our Interim report to you on December 11th and in our subsequent communications to you ahead of our work on the Production phase, which will begin in Mid January. We look forward to hearing more from you today. As we look at mandate implementation. Today, Working Group members will first hear responses to questions posed at the Mandate implementation briefing on 30 October. As you're aware, answers provided by the Secretariat were shared under cover of a letter from the co chairs on the 12th of November and these will also be made available on the UN80 Initiative website. Additionally, as advised in that letter, Working Group members will have the opportunity today to express their their views on mandate implementation and we look forward to hearing your ideas and proposals. We invite you please to submit your interventions as well as any additional inputs by uploading these to the Edelegate portal, as well as sending these to us in writing via our email address@unity mandates.co chairs Gmail. As expressed in our last meeting, we intend to compile and publish the contributions of Working Group members on the UNAT Initiative website unless otherwise indicated by you. Your inputs will contribute to building a comprehensive picture of how we might better tackle mandates in the future. I now pass the floor to my co Chair, Ambassador Schwalgo.

**IAHWG** | Carolyn Schwalger, Co-Chair
Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Before we turn to the questions posed to the briefers, we just wanted to take this opportunity to share that as Co Chairs, we have recently held engagements with the presidents of the Boards and leadership teams of several UN funds, programs and agencies to deepen our understanding of how the issue of mandate creation, implementation and review is being considered in their organisations and what this could mean for the Working Groups, development, deliberations and approach going forward. We have also been meeting with the Chairs of the Main Committees and the co facilitators of the GA revitalization process to ensure that we understand their operating context and any implications for this Working Group. We also wish to inform members of the Working Group that we, as Co Chairs, will hold a meeting on 19 November in coordination with the Executive Office of the Secretary General, to hear directly from UN system entities on their experiences with mandate implementation and to exchange views on how the review can be made more meaningful and impactful. In particular, we will focus on strengthening UN system engagement and exploring how analytical work can best support the deliberations of this Working Group. We also plan to travel to Geneva and Vienna in early January to undertake further consultations with Member States and UN system entities there. So it is now my honour to offer the floor to our briefers, who will provide additional answers to Questions posed at the 30 October briefing on Mandate implementation. First, I give the floor to Mr. Guy Ryder, under Secretary General, for Policy to further elaborate on the answers provided to Member States in the form of visual illustrations and follow up to the many questions raised during the recent briefing on mandate implementation. Floor is yours. Thank you.

**UN Secretariat** | Guy Ryder, USG Policy
In the first instance, Ambassador Schwalger, Ambassador Wallace, thank you for this opportunity to be one of the briefers in today's session of the Working Group. And more than that, thank you for the extraordinary leadership you're providing in the work of the Working Group. And I think the attendance in the room this morning is evidence of the very strong engagement of Member States in the important work you are carrying out. Now. Let me say that it is important that we do continue to work together on the discussion of the overall life cycle approach to mandates that we are basing our work upon. Focusing today, of course, most particularly on the delivery stage of the life cycle. Do I have graphics on the screen? I do. Can I give you some perhaps context to the discussion today? As has been mentioned by Ambassador Wallace, we shared some written responses to the questions raised at the session of 30th of October. You have received them and I don't think it would be a useful use of your time to repeat what is in those responses. So instead I can perhaps use this time to highlight what seemed to us to be some of the key points that we shared and provide just a little bit of context in some areas that may be of relevance. I want to begin by underlining why the work that is being done here is so critically important, why it is essential that we streamline and strengthen the UN system's mandate delivery. If we take a look at our resource situation, you look at the graphic ahead of us. It's not a new graphic. You can see that we are projecting that resources across the entirety of of the United nations systems might well shrink by as much as 25% in 2026 next year compared to the levels of 2024. And I think that provides a very clear message to us that we simply must focus on optimizing processes, eliminating duplications, if we are to continue to serve the people who need our assistance most. Let me then turn to some more specific aspects in relation to mandate delivery, which is the focus of today's session. The first point that I could perhaps make relates to reports. Let me again draw your attention to two statistics, two numbers that we've already shared, but is perhaps worth lingering on again. If you look at this graphic, you will see that a total of 66% of reports cover recurring topics. Topics have come on, come back again and again, and 46% of our reports are produced either annually or more frequently than annually. So if you look at the red boxes here, you will see that those two boxes up to 46%, sort of. In very plain terms, this means that we are spending considerable time and resources writing reports on the same or similar issues in successive years. And of course, in many cases, this is absolutely necessary and appropriate. We understand that annual updates are often appropriate and necessary, but that does not or should not disguise the possibility that there may be opportunities to optimize the format, the length or the periodicity of certain reports. I cannot claim that the statistics before you are conclusive, but they are certainly suggestive. On the other hand, and in some instances, to preserve both Member States bandwidth and respect, that and the Secretariat's capacity, it might be worth considering whether some reports could shift to a biannual or even longer cycle of publication. That's reports. Let's move on to funding issues. Colleagues, on funding, the graphic before you shows that the UN system's work relies on very heavily on voluntary contributions. Roughly 80% of our total resources are from voluntary contributions, and therefore only 20 are derived from assessed funding of any kind. This also shows that the UN Secretariat accounts for only a relatively small share of overall system resources. Most UN system funding, and therefore most delivery, takes place outside the Secretariat across funds, programs and specialized agencies. And this level of voluntary funding dependence means that the way that voluntary funding is provided its predictability, its flexibility, or its earmarking has a major impact on how effectively we can deliver on the mandates that you hand to us. The other dimension of this consideration concerns the size of the grant packages, the funding packages that we get. I think it is noteworthy that 63% of our grants are for amounts below $1 million. This funding comes in small packages. A large share of our funding is delivered in these many small transactions, and each of these naturally carries with it its own administrative requirements. And inevitably, the consequence is of a high administrative cost per individual grant compared with larger grants, consolidated contributions. This is a situation which raises the level of overhead costs. In addition, in past years there has been declining support for pooled funds. Less than 10% of voluntary funding came through pooled funds in development and humanitarian action. And that is far below the target established in the Funding Compact, which was a target of 30%. The target was 30%. The reality is 10%. And here too is an area where it would be extremely valuable if this Working group could take a closer look at remedial action. May I? Also, without going beyond that, I'm conscious of the need not to do so beyond the boundaries of the work of of this Working Group. Draw your attention to proposals which are included in Work Stream 3, the report on Workstream 3 that was published by the Secretary General shortly before High Level Week, which relate to this topic. For your reference, they are in paragraphs 97 to 101 of the Secretary General's Report on Workstream 3. I think you will notice from this that there is a clear area this is a clear area where Work Streams two and three do converge. In our Work Stream two report, we have identified specific challenges to mandate delivery, and in Work Stream 3, we try to identify specific avenues to address the challenges in terms of our structures and our programs. In the meeting on the 30th of October, several of you asked how we can address issues of fragmentation in our delivery. Issues of fragmentation and duplication have been recurring issues in our Work Stream 3 report. To reference it again, we provided some avenues to address fragmentation, such as scaling up common services, creating a single entry point for macroeconomic analysis, and establishing joint knowledge hubs. But generally speaking, we need to assess where different UN entities have a comparative advantage and how they can work together to leverage those comparative advantages to best effect. And one way to approach that challenge is to look at what particular function an entity fulfills. In the graphic before you, we list some of the big categories of function, normative support, policy advice, data and statistics, capacity building, convening, service delivery and support, and other functions. What we are trying to get to through this lens is where each part of the UN system can deliver on the aspect of a mandate that it is best equipped to handle with clear divisions of labor, which would help to eliminate dangers of duplication. If that sounds rather abstract, let me just try to give an example to illustrate the point. It's an example taken simply because it does illustrate the point, rather than for any other reason, the issue of global vaccination program. So the WHO provides the normative and technical guidance and policy advice, setting the global standards for childhood vaccinations, and working with governments on how to translate global vaccination goals, international public health plans. That's one function. Gavi, not strictly part of the UN system, supports the funding function, and UNICEF in turn focuses on support functions such as procurement to vaccine delivery on the ground, working with your national health authorities to reach families and children to deliver the vaccinations. And here you see what might at first sight look like duplication is in fact a very efficient and complementary division along functional complementary functional lines. In this way, UN entities play Complementary, not duplicative, roles, ensuring that together we can deliver the greatest possible impact. So, co chairs, those were some of the additional clarifications that I wanted to share. I hope they're helpful to you and of course I look forward to listening to your statements and to our continued conversations around the UN systems Mandate delivery. Thank you very much.

**IAHWG** | Carolyn Schwalger, Co-Chair
Thank you. Very helpful. Thank you. Under Secretary General Ryder, I now give the floor to His Excellency Christian Venavesa, Permanent Representative of Liechtenstein. We're particularly interested in hearing from you on which measures you would prioritise to improve mandate impact and any thoughts you might have on reporting, given that came up very frequently and the mandate implementation briefing and of course, any of the other questions that were posed. The floor is yours.

**LIE** | Christian Wenaweser, PR
Great. Thank you so much. It's very good to be back. And again, big thanks to you for steering this process in such a structured and transparent way. I think people know that the questions asked were mostly asked to the Secretariat and that will not take up that much time for that reason. And you've already heard extremely helpful replies from Guy Ryder and I will focus on on what Carolyn has just mentioned. In particular, measures to improve impact and efficiency across the system. As far as mandates, as you know from my briefing, I strongly believe that we should put more efforts into crafting our mandates very carefully. And I think that would be my biggest wish and my most important suggestion. So there has to be consultation. There have to be consultations, not just among ourselves states, but also with the relevant parts of the Secretariat, which honestly will help us to just understand what we are doing and what we are proposing. And in particular, if we are proposing something that is perhaps already done or in part already done. So we do believe that a consultation on substance, but also on procedure and on whether something is legally sound is extremely important to craft good mandates and to also have an understanding of what the implementation of a mandate will cost. So we believe every resolution should be costed and that we should, before making a decision on how we express ourselves on a proposed new mandate, that we know the financial aspect of a decision. Linked to this is the question of reporting that you have also flagged. Carolyn, as you know, I think the first question for us should be do we need a report? Because we do not believe that every resolution does need a report. The report can be extremely important and can be big value added. But that is not the case always. And right now, I think mentally we are in a sort of space of automaticity. You have a resolution, so you need an SG report. So I think we need to rethink that and look at this, at this differently. Then also think about, well, perhaps it's good to have a report at the beginning to frame a conversation and to give us a real basis to take a topic forward. But maybe as we move ahead in the delivery of a mandate, and Guy has made it very clear in his comments how many reports are on regularly recurring topics and maybe the moment will come where the membership has sufficient information or is sufficiently served with being provided additional information and things that have changed. There are in fact reports that consist mainly of submissions by Member States. These reports tend to be extremely duplicative and repetitive. Sometimes they're very lengthy. These are probably reports, we don't need it all anymore. But again, it should be something that we look at as proponents of mandates, but also as those who are consulted and as part of the negotiations. The periodicity is also something that is best looked at at the very beginning if you propose a new mandate. I think, again, this sort of reflex to say we do this every year because I think it's important is not necessarily, I mean, I don't think that is actually accurate. I think it can have an extremely important mandate that is, that is discussed only three or five years. And that is something we should think about when we, when we draft our mandates. And this is linked also a little bit on impact, but also on the question, what are we doing here? Is this forward looking, is this backward looking? So certainly we would hope that we will have a much better toolbox for ourselves as we move ahead in our work, as we move forward, as we start crafting new mandates, as of course we will and as we have to, and that we implement the measures that are being discussed here, but that will also allow us to do it with already existing mandates because they typically come back. So if we embrace a new way of doing this and if we embrace new best practices, of course that can then be applied also, also to mandates as they, as they come back and as we resubmit or renew them. So that is probably it for me. And thanks for having me. It's a great pleasure to offer my comments.

**IAHWG** | Carolyn Schwalger, Co-Chair
Thank you. That's really helpful as well. We now give the floor to Mr. Martin Kamani, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Africa center and former Permanent Representative of Kenya, to respond to the question posed to him during the briefing on mandate implementation. And for your memory, that question read, to what extent, extent can the UN utilize AI for information or knowledge management and what is needed to become future ready? And Martin of course, you're very welcome to share any brief reactions to any of the other questions posed as well. Floor is yours.

**[Speaker Unknown]**
Thank you very much. VR and Board Chairs, thank you for inviting me once again to deliberate with you on this important topic for this important working group. You asked to what extent the UN can utilize AI for information and knowledge management and what is needed for the organization to become future ready, and I will draw on the remarks that I shared on 30 October which outlined the UN structural knowledge problem and the cost it imposes on implementation. As I briefed you then, the UN is rich in knowledge, yet staff and delegations rarely have that knowledge at the moment of decision. This weakens implementation, slows crisis response, and forces the system to relearn what it already knows. AI cannot replace political judgment, conflict, understanding or diplomacy, but it can remove the friction that consumes staff time and attention. And this is where the opportunity lies. A significant share of UN work is mechanical and rule based. Administrative processing, financial workflows, indicator management, translation support, document retrieval, data cleaning, structured summaries and reference preparation. These processes can be automated quite safely. AI can also assemble inputs for higher level analysis. It can retrieve resolutions, extract factual timelines, surface comparable cases and collate open source reporting. These are repeatable tasks that do not require political sensitivity. In fact, when Kenya was in the Security Council, we had a machine reading team in Nairobi that was doing just that, open source work that helped us a great deal in working on files where Kenya did not have a credible intelligence gathering system. Automation in these areas expands the usable bandwidth of staff who must apply judgment. It reduces the administrative burden that currently constrains the UN's ability to deliver and takes up so much of the financial resources. The Political Call the UN must remain human. Drafting the Secretary General's reports, the political analysis, the mandate interpretation that Christian was talking about, the conflict assessment, early warning, judgment negotiations, mapping of red lines, the way narratives are framed in complex and crisis situations. These depend on contextual understanding and sensitivity to member state positions. They require tacit knowledge acquired through experience and AI cannot perform these functions. So the aim I was talking about last time, and as I repeat now, is reinforcement of political work, not its substitution. Automation strengthens the UN core mandate in three ways. First, deeper analysis. Analysts gain more time for political consultation, reading and scenario testing when no longer required to reconstruct timelines or search for documents. Early warning improves when staff focus on incentives, power dynamics and emerging risks. Second, faster and clearer decisions. Decision cycles accelerate when automated systems produce timelines, comparable cases, legal references, etc. Thirdly, diplomacy strengthens, negotiation improves when envoys have more time for bilateral consultations and political outreach. Automated retrieval, past commitments, voting patterns and red lines frees you to have the energy to shape outcomes. And especially this point is relevant to the smallest missions that struggle with the present workload. So automation protects the space for human political judgment and therefore increases both delegations and Secretariat's capacity without expanding headcount. We also have to respond to the new cyber threat environment. The AI enabled cyber espionage campaign that was documented by Anthropic, which runs Claude AI. If you use it. This mid September, just a few weeks ago, marked a turning point. For the first time it showed a state sponsored actor using an AI model to conduct reconnaissance, exploitation and essentially to undertake the attack at scale with minimal human oversight. The operational cost for adversaries has dropped while the speed and automation of the attacks has increased. The UN is exposed. Its digital environment is fragmented, it's unevenly secured and it's filled with sensitive political and humanitarian data. The risks are theft and contamination of its knowledge systems, disruption of mission communications, and of course, erosion of trust in its analysis. So what's a realistic UN response? I think that requires three actions as I close. One, the UN has to harden its systems. It has to establish a single minimum security standard across the Secretariat funds and programs. And it has to focus on practical steps that reduce fragmentation in the UN's digital environment. This is achievable with the SG's direction and your support financially in the fifth committee. Second, it needs AI assisted threat detection. And third, it needs support to Member States. The UN should offer simple, cost effective cyber resilience packages to LDCs and fragile states. These should include basic protection measures, guidance on secure digital services and help with incident response. The UN cannot defend countries against every cyber threat, but it can raise the minimum level of security for those with the least resources. And I highly recommend this to the LDCs and other developing states. In terms of its workforce implications and the realistic constraints. We know that AI will transform global labor markets. We know that it will transform education systems and industrial strategies. If the UN development system remains centered on project cycles and reporting, it will not meet what Member States need. The UN will need more policy expertise in economics, education reform, labor market design, industrial transformation and digital governance that is aware and expert on AI. And AI can support these experts with modeling and evidence synthesis. The UN cannot compete with industry for elite AI engineers or cyber specialists, but it can bring in targeted expertise through second men's partnerships and short term consultancies. It can also go further. It can build a fellowship, something that we can call an AI core or some other name, which is a structured global fellowship program that would bring engineers, alignment researchers and cyber AI specialists into the UN for a period of time. They would work on secure architecture, digital public goods and knowledge systems. In return, they gain exposure to context they would never otherwise encounter. I meet so many young people who would love to work at the un. Give them that opportunity in the AI realm and I'm sure some top talent will come for some period of time. This model would be realistic if it's funded by member states, philanthropies and universities perhaps, and it supplements political and development staff rather than replacing them. So in closing, what's a future ready AI? In quick point form? It treats knowledge infrastructure as core institutional infrastructure. It automates rule based and repetitive workflows. It protects political functions as entirely human. It modernizes cybersecurity to confront AI enabled threats. It adjusts workforce composition towards technical and analytical expertise. It establishes a standing experimentation unit with the authority to test and iterate. It anchors regional pilots in Africa where most nexus contexts lie. It publishes evidence on gains in search, retrieval speed, analysis time and decision speed. In conclusion, AI will not solve political disagreements or compensate for unclear mandates. It will not replace diplomacy, conflict analysis or negotiation. But it can remove mechanical burdens that limit the UN's capacity to act. It can expand the time available for human judgment which is at the heart of conflict prevention and crisis response. It can harden the organizations against the new threat landscape and strengthen its service to member states. I think you have the chance to build a UN that can do all these things that I have spoken about and I encourage you in the working group to recommend a piloting of these approaches as soon as possible. Measure the effect and scale what the evidence supports. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Carolyn Schwalger, Co-Chair
Thanks Martin. You've deeply thought about these issues and I really appreciate, and I'm sure Brian does too, the clarity of the recommendations you've put in front of us as well. We'd now like to invite Ms. Amirah Hark, former United Nations Under Secretary General for the Department of Field Support Support, to provide an answer to a couple of questions that were in her field. One of those questions relates to how can system wide coordination mechanisms such as the ceb, un, sdg, IASC be used to improve coherent mandate implementation? And the other question is what drives so many entities to spread themselves so thin across so many mandates? And how can better coordination reduce competition for resources? And of course you're also welcome to share any brief reactions to other questions posed. The floor is yours.

**[Speaker Unknown]**
Thank you very much. In response to the first question, in terms of system wide coordination mechanisms, I mean, there is absolutely, I think, no debate whatsoever on the need for coordination mechanisms. But I think where we need to investigate the time, the transactional costs that are incurred in these mechanisms is the key question. So coordination mechanisms absolutely necessary at the level of CEB and the UNSDG and iasc. But I think when Guy was speaking, I, you know, noted that in the implementation he had written that, you know, we need to focus constantly on improving people's lives. And you know, I can, I can sort of think of if we start each one of these meetings, numerous meetings and other mechanisms that we have in terms of saying, is the time spent, is the time that we're going to spend on this meeting. What is the direct correlation of the time spent in this meeting to actually making an impact and improving someone's lives? I think, you know, that kind of cross sectional analysis is very good in terms of, you know, how much time are we spending, to what effect and what are the actual results. The second thing with respect to these coordination mechanisms and which I observed in the field, particularly when I was in the field in these coordination roles, is that what is discussed and agreed at headquarters doesn't necessarily find its way down to the field representatives. So sometimes we have a situation where I think headquarters and the policy level feels quite, you know, satisfied that yes, we have made these kind of agreements and, you know, certain policies are in place. But I think when you go down to the field level, sometimes at the field, the same kind of discussions which have already been agreed to at headquarters are taking place at the field level. So there is that duplicative nature and that the decisions of headquarters not being transmitted in, I would have to say, in a rather forceful way to representatives on the ground to adhere to what has already been agreed. And so there is a lot of repetitiveness and there's a lot of time spent again at the field level. The third in terms of coordination mechanism is also the host government's role that the UN does not do this coordination, whether it's at the CEB or the UNSDG or iasc in isolation it is working. It is in a host government. And likewise there has to be a parallel mechanism at the host country level that accepts this. So Guy made a very good example of Health and gavi. But very often we would see that a ministry of, say, Maternal and Child Health doesn't necessarily, you know, adhere to something that has come from the planning ministry. And so even at the host government level, there is sometimes a reluctance to come together, to assume a kind of coordination or a leadership maybe of one technical ministry. So the UN in its coordination mechanisms has to have that translated at a host government, host nation level as well. And that also proves one of the challenges of this system wide coordination. And the last point that I would make on this is that member states who are providing the funding are also, you know, I think, bear some responsibility in terms of this fragmentation. And, you know, I was struck by, by the number of grants that are below $1 million, because whether a grant is $1 million or below $1 million or $20 million or more, you know, the same level of administrative and other things, you know, Ambassador Kimani talked about, maybe AI can, you know, can take some of these, but, you know, it still requires the same amount of work because the accountabilities that are set in for a project or a program that is below $1 million is the same accountability of something that is $20 million. So there again is where the transactional costs of these kinds of coordination mechanisms I think, have just gone way beyond, as I said, if we measure, what do all these levels of reports, meetings, discussions and everything else translate actually into improving people's lives? So that is my few words on the system wide coordination. As I said, it is absolutely necessary, but I think it can be streamlined. I think it can be more disciplined. I think there can be more, you know, reaching out to both member states who are providing funding and to the host nations where we are working to also embrace and, you know, try and work within these mechanisms in their respective sides. The second question was, what drives so many entities to spread themselves so thin across many mandates? And how can better coordination reduce competition for resources? And when I read that question, I said, you know, the answer is actually in the, in the question itself because all entities, all UN entities are competing for limited number, limited amount of resources. And that is why sometimes if again, to take the example of the health sector, but, you know, it applies equally if someone is doing the implementation and the, you know, the procurement, for example, of vaccines and all the, you know, equipment and other things that are required for it. But if the, you know, the sort of the supply chain in terms of a policy within the government is not there, it's very difficult for the procurement to happen in isolation. And so what happens is there is a tendency then for someone who wants to make sure that the vaccines are implemented and that go right down to the deep field where all this is so essential, they automatically want to get involved also in the policy, in the funding. So it's very difficult. Even though we may have specializations, it's very difficult to kind of separate that. And the other thing that is so evident in the chart that was put up on the voluntary funding and the assessment funding is that, particularly when I was in the peacekeeping and peace operations, a lot of what came in the assist contributions should have been passed on to UN agencies who have the expertise and the experience and the knowledge of the country, you know, where they have been working for a long time. And a lot could, could be done there. It was, I think I mentioned that it was very, very difficult. It is very difficult still to have that kind of passage between voluntary and assessed fundings again, you know, with, with having the chapeau of is this improving people's lives. But what happens is that we get into more thinking about silos and accountabilities and being able to deliver on something in order to be able to attract resources. So again, here I feel there are responsibilities, and in this context, I would say more with member states who are providing the funding. In the PC peacekeeping world that I was in, there was a total disconnect between those members of the foreign affairs ministries who were working to prepare the implementation and for example, the ministries of planning or development, and others who needed to look at early recovery. So sometimes we had, in different parts of the UN almost at the same time, resolutions of funding decisions that were taking that were, that were not coordinated within that member state itself. And I think that's where, you know, a lot of improvement in, within the coordination mechanisms and this ability to have each entity spread themselves so thin, thinking that, okay, if I have this in this program, it'll attract a little more money from this member state, because that's one of their country's priorities, too. And so you kind of, you're fitting what you're going to do based on where you might align yourself with a member state's priorities, other than looking at, again, that central thing of improving people's lives where we are present. So I think it's difficult to see one element of a mandate in isolation and also the accountability sometimes become very difficult. And I think that's why so many entities are spreading themselves thin just in order to be able to capitalize on the very limited resources that are available for this particular issue. So thank you very much. I'll leave it at that.

**IAHWG** | Carolyn Schwalger, Co-Chair
Thank you so much, Amira. It's so helpful to be reminded of the realities on the ground, and so we've really appreciated having you as a briefer. That now brings us to the end of the briefers responding to your questions, and I pass the floor back to Ambassador Wallace.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you, Carolyn. I now open the floor for Working Group members to share their views on mandate implementation. We continue to look forward to hearing your ideas and proposals to make mandate implementation more efficient, effective and impactful. As usual, delegations are asked to keep their interventions to five minutes for groups and three minutes for individual delegations, and I see already quite a number of delegations who are interested to speak, so we're going to ask you to be disciplined on maintaining the time. I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Iraq on behalf of the Group of 77 and China

**IRQ**, Representative
Excellencies Co Chairs. Good morning. I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the group of 77 and Chan at the House of the Group wishes to express its appreciation to the Co Chairs for convening this important discussion and for the informative briefing held on 30th October which provided valuable insights into this important topic. The Group further extends its gratitude to the panelists for their insightful presentations and valuable contributions. The Group emphasizes that mandates achieve impact only through effective implementation, often requiring concerted efforts across multiple entities and areas of work. Reflecting the Organization's multidimensional and cross cutting nature, the Group reaffirms that the overarching goal of the UNAT Initiative is to make the United nations more agile, resilient and capable of delivering high quality and efficient services while eliminating redundancy and overlap in mandate implementation. The Group notes proposals for a common administrative platform and merging several of ongoing entities, departments, offices under the UNAT Initiative, emphasizing that any such process should enhance mandates implementation and service delivery while remaining fully guided by intergovernmental oversight and the authority of Member States. The Group believes that the successful implementation of mandates requires translating general aspirations into specific, measurable outcomes with clearly defined objectives. It is therefore essential to engage closely with with the Secretariat, whose role should remain supportive in nature on the modalities of implementation while reaffirming the prerogative of Member States to define objectives and expected outcomes. Co Chairs the Group recognized that artificial intelligence tools may offer advantages in identifying potential duplicative mandates and overlapping implementation across mandating bodies. However, their use must be approached with caution given risks related to privacy, security, and the sensitive nature of intergovernmental work, as well as concerns about accuracy and transparency. Any consideration of such tools should therefore ensure adequate safeguards and that budgetary implications remain imaginable in the current challenging financial context. The Group considers it important to receive comprehensive information on the intergovernmental bodies that have established and overseen the implementation of specific mandates, including updates on the status of implementation and the underlining reasons for any non or partial implementation. Such information would contribute to a clearer understanding of challenges and facilitate more informed discussions among Member States. The Group also underscores the importance of ensuring that the Secretariat maintains a neutral and balanced role in mandate implementation. It is essential that all entities act strictly in accordance with mandates approved by Member States. The Group further calls for mandate implementation to be measurable and supported by a system wide evaluation mechanism. A key component of this effort is the need to link mandate decisions with projected costs and to identify opportunities to enhance efficiency, coherence and accountability throughout the implementation process. Co Chairs to conclude, the Group of 77 and China retreats a strong commitment to engage constructively in this process. We emphasize that discussions to mandate implementation or mandate implementation must remain inclusive, transparent and efficient, ensuring full oversight and participation by all Member States. I thank you.

I thank the G77 and China. I give the floor now to the European Union.

**EU**, Representative
Thank you, Mr. Co Chair and dear colleagues. I delivered this statement on behalf of the EU and its Member States. The candidate countries, Turkey, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Georgia, as well as Armenia, Monaco and San Marino, align themselves with this statement. We thank the Co Chairs for your remarkable coordination of this Working Group. We also would like to thank the Secretariat for the responses provided and for issuing a structured action plan to further consolidate the work on UN80 and establish a system wide framework for action. On today's topic of mandate implementation, allow me to highlight the following three points to address the proliferation of meetings and reports. The EU calls for a system wide review to reduce duplication and create efficiencies, limiting meetings and reports in number, length and frequency. Take for example the First Committee, which managed to finish its work earlier than scheduled this year. We encourage the streamlining and rationalization of mandated meetings and reporting requests, as well as any measures aimed at reducing repetition across organs and bodies and resources. We fully support the proposal to produce shorter reports and to combine them wherever possible. In this regard, the work on revitalization of the General assembly and its Committee, as well as reform efforts across other bodies, takes on added significance. 2 We recognize that misaligned funding modalities and resource fragmentation constitute a serious challenge for the effective implementation of UN mandates, especially in times of liquidity crisis. Therefore, we support granting flexibility to the Secretariat for the allocation of resources across programs and regions when justified by operational priorities or crisis, and following the implementation of accountability frameworks regulated by clear criteria. The EU also underlines the importance of applying the mutual commitments as agreed in the Funding Compact to strengthen the predictability, quality and transparency of financial contributions and the third point on the division of labor among UN entities. This must be further clarified to avoid unnecessary duplication and functional overlaps. To enhance coordination and information exchange, we support the strategic use of resources through existing system wide coordination platforms and the enhancement of interagency coordination to effectively manage mandate delivery. Also in the field, the integration of open, transparent and trustworthy use of AI into the mandate registry to showcase substantial similarities, potential duplications, risks and overlaps is also something that we support. We also welcome the integration of digital technologies aimed at modernizing the UN system through shared data platforms, digital dashboards and analytics, paired with human oversight and clear accountability frameworks. Lastly, we also support a more adaptive approach to mandate implementation, implementation based on agility, exchange of best practices and measurable impact. Implementation plans should allow for adjustments in methods, timelines or resource allocation in response to evolving contexts and evidence of impact. Dear Colleagues, the UN AD initiative demands more than compartmentalized efforts. It requires an ambitious and truly system wide approach across the Secretariat, organs, committees, agencies and Member States in order to ensure that reform outputs directly translate into more coherent, cost effective, impactful and field responsive operations. Work streams may advance in parallel, but they are not isolated from one another and therefore we must make sure that they mutually inform each other. We also encourage continuous coordination between our discussions on the mandate implementation review and other processes, including GA revitalization efforts, ongoing GA Committee work, and the review of working methods and information exchanges between the Secretariat and Member States. In their capacities as members of the Boards of agencies, funds and programs, the European Union and its Member States stand ready to continue to contribute constructively to the next steps and I thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the European Union colleagues, I'm going to ask for your indulgence to allow me to use the Chair's prerogative to invite to depart from the group statements momentarily to allow our colleague Bob Ray of Canada to make what will be undoubtedly his actual final statement here before his actual imminent departure from New York. Bob, you have the floor.

**CAN** | Bob Rae
I'm a little overwhelmed by the alacrity with which this has been done. It really stems from a conversation that I had with Carolyn about her job and some of the challenges that we face. And although I did give a farewell speech yesterday, this will be the last statement that I'll make. The last, last one, I assure you. And I don't want to take anything away from James, who is going to be giving the joint statement on behalf of Cans, which is. Provides in greater detail and much more substance what I'm. What I wanted to share with you. I think we need to have the most honest dialogue we can about how this place works and doesn't work and what it's going to take to make it change. And I really just want to encourage everyone to try in conversation and in discussion as much as possible, to actually engage in conversation and dialogue about what we need to do in private conversation. I've noticed that everyone agrees that our work could be more productive, more pleasant and ultimately more impactful if we recognize that to a certain extent we're all caught up in simply doing a series of ritual activities which are there because they're ritual activities. Now, to those who say we've got to go back to the basics of the Charter, let me remind everyone the Charter doesn't actually tell us all the things we the structure of meetings, how long mandates last for, whether we can change mandates, whether we can simplify processes. None of that is in the Charter. It's simply in the operational side of our decision making, which we can change and which we are free to change. Changing the Charter is very difficult. Changing our methods of work should not be difficult. These are real time, real life decisions in the UN 80 process. The three pillars that have been set up. May produce some results, may produce some changes, but at the very least, we need to start from the premise that the reason we're having this conversation now in this way is because of money. So if somebody says this has nothing to do with money, it has to do with money. If it wasn't for the cuts that have been imposed on us by our funders Member States, we wouldn't be going through the changes that we're being asked to consider. The mandates exercise, in my opinion, and I offer it only as an opinion, is exceptionally important part of this exercise because it speaks to the extent to which we have turned the methods of work into a kind of iconography. We worship at the altar of these ways in which we do things without regard to whether we can afford it or whether it's actually useful. And that speaks to everything that we do with respect to the volume of work which we generate and which we then ask the Secretariat in turn to generate. I do not spend the day reading every report that's produced by the Secretariat and I would be very surprised if any of you did either. Nor do any of us in reality take entirely at face value the extent to which our lives are dominated by a set of practices and rules which are arcane, outdated and could be changed. And so I would encourage you to keep the faith in being as straightforward as possible in confronting the need for change. And I would encourage the co chairs to continue with their ambition of trying to create as much real discussion as possible on the changes that are in fact possible. We are the prisoners of our own making, but we each have a key to break the lock. We just have to have the courage to find the key and use it and not be afraid of the fact that across various geographical groupings, ideological groupings, other divisions which exist among us, there's actually more consensus among us about the changes that we could make if we wanted to make them. So I'm not here to offer you a magic plan or to say you must do this or that. I'm only here to say that it's a mistake to think that this is another ritual exercise. It's not. Because unless the UN becomes more effective and impactful, it will become less relevant and we're the only ones who can actually change it. The delegates of countries meeting together are the only people who can actually say, here are some things we must do to make the organization more relevant and more impactful. And we can in fact do that. Il est completement possibly pour launu de function plus efficasma avec plus de clarte et evec moi de rituel. C' est d' arnau poir pouvoir de la fe, La facon d'.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you. Thank you, Bob and bon voyage. I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Singapore on behalf of a group of states.

**SGP**, Representative
Good morning colleagues. Thank you very much. Co chairs, it's always a challenge to speak after Ambassador Bob Ray. We will miss his wisdom and eloquence and we wish him all the best. Au reboire. As we say to each other, colleagues, Co chairs, I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the Small States Group. A cross regional grouping of small states comprising both developed and developing countries and a list of 53 countries have aligned with the statement. And for the sake of efficient time management, we will make available the list of countries later to the Co Chairs Co Chairs the mandates are essentially an expression of the will and priorities of Member States. Every mandate is a political commitment established with the expectation that it will be fully implemented. Mandates should therefore be drafted in an informed and intentional manner and clearly articulated so that meaningful impact can be achieved through effective delivery. Allow me to make three points on how mandate implementation can be improved. First, strong knowledge management and effective use of technology can play an important enabling role in successful mandate implementation. Improved data systems will allow Member States and the Secretariat to better fulfill their respective roles in requesting for and implementing mandate delivery. For instance, enhanced data systems could include the capacity to view the status of mandate implementation and the entity that is responsible for implementation. Broadly speaking, the establishment of a comprehensive registry would inform users of areas for potential streamlining, which can then be tabled as proposals for consideration by Member States. While the creation of a robust registry will require time and resources, it will be a powerful tool to reduce duplications. Second, the creation and implementation of UN activities and reports would benefit from greater coordination. This is part of a necessary shift in mindset and culture. We should seek to incentivise a stronger sense of shared ownership and collective responsibility over the mandate life cycle. Member States should be open to new configurations of mandated products or modalities of mandate delivery. The aim is to achieve mandated objectives through more efficient and measurable outcomes. As for reports, Member States should empower the Secretariat to produce more concise and useful reports, with a focus on content and analysis that contribute to impactful mandate delivery. Thirdly, the Secretariat and UN entities must address fragmentations in mandate delivery and strengthen internal coordination as an ongoing practice. These two entails a shift in organizational mindset and culture. A number of factors contribute to the problem of duplication and inefficiency, which include different parts of the system working in silos and competition for resources between agencies. Stronger internal coordination and division of labor must be embedded as a matter of course in the process of mandate implementation and delivery management within the UN. We note the Secretariat's proposal in the UN 80 Initiative Action Plan and welcome further efforts by the Secretariat to improve internal coordination and streamlining of mandate delivery. Co Chairs, small States have always been consistent supporters of the UN and the multilateral system. At the same time, we are also among the most affected when the system becomes overburdened. We reiterate our strong commitment to engaging constructively with all Member States and the Secretariat to ensure that the process of mandate implementation is more coordinated, accountable and efficient so as to meet our common objective of effective mandate delivery Co Chairs, Please allow me to make a few additional points in my national capacity.

**SGP**, Representative
First, I want to thank the briefers for their very insightful opening remarks. I found them very useful and and I hope that this will give us additional material for reflection. Second, I agree with our colleague from Liechtenstein that fundamentally, implementation has to be related to the question of how mandates are crafted in the first place. The greater the clarity and specificity, the better it will be for all of us in terms of measuring and monitoring the implementation of mandates. In this regard, I think there is a case to be made to look at the length of resolutions. A longer and more voluminous resolution does not necessarily make the mandate broader or deeper. It may well end up providing very vague and confusing instructions or guidelines, not just to the Secretariat but also to other Member States. It is worth thinking, in my view, of a standardized template for resolutions that States can use as a guide as they begin to craft mandates, especially for resolutions that are new. Ultimately, of course, states would have the sovereign rights and the option to craft their own mandates. But I think it is time that we make the mindset mindset shift to look at shorter and more succinct resolutions, aided hopefully by the idea of a guiding of some guidelines or templates. The second point that I wanted to make in my national capacity has to do with the question of periodicity. This has come up quite regularly. I think we need to make a distinction between activity and accomplishment. So the greater frequency of activity does not mean that we are accelerating accomplishment or mandate implementation. We can adopt a resolution every six months. That does not mean that we are accelerating the implementation of a mandate or making a difference to improving people's lives in the field. So that's the first point that I wanted to make with regard to this larger point about periodicity. Second, we need to make a distinction between an agenda item, a resolution or a draft decision, and reports of the UN Secretary General. An agenda item can be discussed annually, but a resolution need not be adopted annually. And a report of the Secretary General, even if there is a request for such a report, need not be done annually. So let me offer the example of the revitalization we have co chairs here present with us this morning. We look at there's an agenda item on revitalization that is discussed annually, but the resolution is adopted biannually. So it's entirely possible that an item is placed on the agenda, and that's the decision of the General Committee that looks at the list of the agenda item. An item is placed on the agenda possibly annually, but we don't need a resolution to be adopted annually. It could be done biannually or triannually. And we don't need a report of the SG on every agenda item on an annual basis. It could be done biannually, triennially or even beyond. So I really think the data presented by the Secretariat Under Secretary General Guy Ryder about how we spend 10% of our budget on writing reports is not just financially not sustainable. It is simply not possible for any of us to read all the reports that we ourselves demand. So I hope to have further discussions with all Member States on these important issues. Once again, thank you Co Chairs for your leadership.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Singapore. I give the floor now to the Philippines on behalf of the middle Income countries.

**PHL**, Representative
Thank you Co Chairs. I have the honor to speak on behalf of the Like Minded Group for Middle Income Countries or LMG Mix, composed of Armenia, Belarus, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Lebanon, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, Panama, Peru, the Philippines and Uruguay. As this is the first time that the Group is addressing this process, we wish to express our support and thank the Co Chairs for the consultations held thus far as well as the panelists for their insights. Co Chairs Middle income countries represent more than half of the UN membership, are home to more than 70% of the global population and contribute as the third of the global GDP. Most of the world's poor, nearly 2/3 also reside within our countries. Further, even countries that achieve graduation from LDCs to middle income status and those middle income countries that aim for high income status continue to face structural barriers on their paths to sustainable development and well being of their people. It does needs to be emphasized that middle income countries are a group of countries facing specific challenges that need to be addressed and these realities should also inform the UN process including mandate implementation. Co Chairs allow me to highlight the following first, review of mandates across the UN system should be towards effectiveness and efficiency. We underscore the importance of the potential range and impact of mandate implementation. Second, the LMG MIX has so far requested and mandated very few and very reasonable concrete deliverables from the UN system which are intended to create greater impact on the ground. The Group looks forward to the elaboration of an interagency system wide response plan for middle income countries and reiterates the call for the UN Sustainable Development Group to fill leadership gaps on mixed issues. Third, the LMG MICS appreciates the continued support by DESA as well as its reporting functions and substantive contributions to the Intergovernmental processes on the agenda of middle income countries. Fourth, the LMG mix supports advancing a pragmatic approach to delivering results. Addressing the middle income trap through tailored support for middle income countries requires collaboration. Hence the Group is pushing for a strategic plan of action for mics. Lastly, this review process on mandate implementation should be geared towards accelerating efforts to fulfill unfinished business or those that are still in its very early stages of implementation, such as the system wide and increased support for middle income countries for a truly impactful outcome to benefit the vast majority of the world's population and ultimately all of us. Thank you Co Chairs and please be assured of our continued engagement in the process.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank Philippines I give the floor now to the distinguished representative of Barbados on behalf of CARICOM

**BRB**, Representative
Co Chairs. I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the 14 member states of the Caribbean Community and I align these remarks with a statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of the group of 77 and China at the outset. We thank you for today's consultations and in particular for the insightful briefing on 30 October. That session offered a clear understanding of the practical realities within which mandate delivery takes place and has helped shape our contribution here today. I'd also like to extend our thanks to the Briefers for their valuable and in some cases thought provoking insights. It's also worth noting, I think, Co Chairs colleagues, that yesterday's discussion in the General assembly on the revitalization of the General assembly highlighted the important convergence between that process and this process. We must use this convergence to generate synergies. In discussing mandate implementation. We are dealing with a stage of the mandate life cycle where Member State decisions must translate into coherent action. This is where clarity, coordination and adequate resources matter the most. For small missions, including those small island developing States such as those of caricom, predictability in how mandates are carried out is essential to effective oversight and to our ability to participate meaningfully. Across the breadth of the UN's work. CO Chair's implementation occurs within a wide and complex institutional landscape. The diversity of entities involved reflects the multidimensional character of global challenges, yet it can also result in uneven fragmented responsibilities in delivery and overlapping activities. CARICOM sees merit in strengthening internal coordination and ensuring that roles are clearly communicated and understood. When entities work to their respective strengths, mandate delivery becomes more coherent, more efficient and ultimately more impactful. We further recognize that reporting forms a significant part of implementation. Reports serve as a key tool for transparency and oversight and they must continue to provide Member States with information that is relevant, clear and analytically useful. CARICOM supports efforts that focus on enhancing the quality and value of reports while ensuring that any adjustments remain firmly rooted in intergovernmental guidance. Co Chair's colleagues Funding modalities also shape implementation in profound ways. The continued reliance on highly earmarked voluntary contributions, combined with the limited flexibility of assessed resources creates challenges for planning and coherence. CARICOM reiterates a long standing principle mandates must be supported by resources that are predictable and proportionate to the tasks required. Bridging the gap between expectations and available resources is fundamental to the credibility of the organization and to the confidence of Member States in this regard. It is critical also for CARICOM that the important and meaningful work being undertaken in the implementation of mandates in the field in our countries and regions and the capacity to do so sustainably does not fall victim to this exercise. What this stage of the discussion underscores is the importance of an organizational approach that promotes coherence, reduces unnecessary duplication and strengthens accountability. These are not technical issues alone as they go to the very core of how the United nations delivers on the priorities that Member States have collectively agreed. Co Chairs CARICOM remains committed to engaging constructively as we move through this process. Our interest is in a mandate implementation environment that is transparent, coordinative, coordinated and responsive one that respects intergovernment, the intergovernmental nature of the mandates while enabling the system to operate effectively and one that supports the ability of small delegations to follow and contribute to the work of the organization in a meaningful way. We thank you Co Chairs for your continued leadership and look forward to contributing to the forthcoming discussions on Mandate review, completing our examination of the life cycle in a way that strengthens the ability of the UN to deliver for all and with your permission I would like to offer one brief comment in my national capacity and it connects to the points underlined in particular by former Undersecretary General Amirah Haq. It is Barbados View that we must pay particular attention in the framing of mandates to their on the ground in the field implementation. It is here as she so powerfully underlined, that the lives of the people we represent can truly be touched. I thank you Co Chairs.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank Barbados. I now give the floor to the Solomon Islands on behalf of the pif.

**SLB**, Representative
Thank you Co Chairs. I'm honored to speak on behalf of the Pacific Island Forum members based in New York. We thank the Co Chairs for the helpful briefing on mandate implementation on 30th October and also for the briefest this morning The Unity Reform Initiative is an important opportunity to make the United nations more effective, efficient and accountable and better able meet today's challenges. This is especially critical for small island developing states, including those in the Pacific, which depend heavily on the UN for support, expertise and development financing. As others have said, how well we implement agreed mandates is a key measure of the UN's performance and of us as member states. Unfortunately, current weaknesses in the mandate implementation, such as poor coordination, too many priorities and lack of restraint, are felt mostly strongly by seeds, including the Pacific Island Forum states. The UN development system is fragmented and lacks coherence on the ground, which limits its ability to deliver for seats and makes it harder for us to access essential assistance. Co Chairs the growing number of resolutions, processes, meetings and report is challenging for all, but it can overwhelm smaller delegations who are supported by small policy teams in their capitals. Fifth, missions are displeased about the recurring overlap between the work of the main committees. For example, earlier this week, on Wednesday, the General assembly plenary held a secret ballot to fill one vacancy at the International Court of Justice. At the same time, recorded votes were held both in the second and the fourth Committees. We are mindful that overlaps can never be entirely prevented. However, it is extremely difficult for small delegations to be in three places at once. There are clear steps we can take to ease these burdens. One, we as Member States should be more disciplined in the meetings we mandate. Fewer, shorter and more focused meetings in core priorities should be outboard. Second, we should only request reports when they serve a clear purpose and justify their cost. Reports should be clear, concise and focused on the key information needed for decision making. Pasig Island Forum countries are especially concerned about the fragmentation of activities and resources across the event system. We urge the Secretariat to continue improving coordination and coherence, especially in the field, so that scarce resources go to activities with real impact rather than duplicated programs or administrative overhead. Co Chairs Coordination mechanisms should strengthen UN impact, not add more bureaucracy. Member states also have a role in reducing duplication and fragmentation. We encourage donors, UN entities and development partners to align their support with regional, national and local priorities and to work through existing plans and coordination mechanisms. Finally, Co Chairs we join others in calling for more stable and flexible financing for the UN system. Uncertainty around voluntary funding and rigid funding models make planning difficult, waste resources, and force UN leadership to spend more time fundraising than implementing mandates. The current liquidity crisis is also paralyzing mandate implementation. We repeat our call for all Member States to pay their assist contributions on time in full and without conditions. We look forward to working closely with all members throughout this process and I thank you for Chairs, I thank the Solomon Islands.

I now give the floor to Kuwait.

**KWT**, Representative
On behalf of the GCC Excellencies, Co Chairs and Distinguished Colleagues, I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of the Member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the gcc, the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Sultan of Oman, the State of Qatar, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and my own country, the State of Kuwait. The GCC aligns itself with the statement delivered by the Republic of Iraq on behalf of the Group of 77 and China Excellencies, let me begin by reiterating our appreciation to Jamaica and New Zealand, the Co Chairs of the Informal Ad Hoc Working Group. As we approach the point of implementation of the mandate review, the responsibility entrusted in this process becomes ever more critical. We would also like to express our gratitude to the panelists for their insightful briefings, perspectives and lessons learned. We echo that the best practices cannot be underplayed to achieve the successful implementation of mandates. The GCC believes that the Secretary General's initiative continues to be a timely and genuine opportunity to achieve qualitative transformations in the methods of work of the United nations, thus strengthening multilateralism and the overall efficiency in the functions of the un. We reaffirm that the process of mandate review and the mechanisms for implementing the findings is imperative and must be conducted through careful assessment and with the highest degree of transparency. Excellencies we welcome the establishment of the UN Mandate Source Registry. While it is still in its beta version. We emphasize that the website serves as a marked achievement in ensuring transparency and accessibility that truly feeds into more robust dialogue regarding mandate implementation. We look forward to advancing the Registry to become a comprehensive source for Member States. We further encourage the utilization of technology in improving the accessibility of Member States to the Registry as well as providing relevant stakeholders with tools to enable their effective engagement with a large amount of data related to mandates. Excellencies, we emphasize the benefit of considering integrating an evaluation mechanism into the text of mandates during mandate design as that would enable relevant stakeholders to assess the different elements that would inform the next iteration of the mandate. We also see the importance of enabling Member States and the Secretariat with the necessary knowledge and capacities to fully engage with the design and creation of said mandates. Moreover, the process of negotiating and drafting falls to the established procedures, yet we consider it essential to provide the required skills for creating mandates. To achieve the effective implementation and review of mandates. True engagement requires a full scope understanding of the material at hand. While the Designation of roles and functions can be left to establish practices and procedures in relation to the use of technology and specifically AI. In the process of drafting mandate setting texts, it is crucial that the human element is preserved and takes precedence wherein the human element is the direct engagement of Member States and certified stakeholders. AI must be utilized as a tool to assist in our prerogatives, while data security and accuracy should remain at the forefront of any and all decisions taken. In conclusion, the GCC reiterates the core principles of the Charter that the IHWG must be beholden to. The process itself must always prioritize the inclusion and leadership of member states. The UN 80 initiative and within all of its precepts is not a downsizing exercise, but an opportunity to increase efficiencies and streamline processes. Thank you, your Excellencies.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank Kuwait. I give the floor now to Australia.

**AUS**, Representative
On behalf of Cairns. Thank you very much indeed, Chair. And I thank the briefers who've contributed this morning. And let me just say thank you so much indeed, Bob, for your final remarks. I think the notion that we are indeed the masters of a fair degree of our own destiny and that we don't need to be prisoners of established processes really is the critical reflection we should take away from this morning. I speak of course, on behalf of Canada, New Zealand and Australia. And as the Secretary General states in the Mandate Implementation Review, mandate delivery is the basis on which Member States and the wider public assess the value of the United nations system. It's critical to the implementation of the United nations three pillars, and we need absolutely to get this process right. Many of the recommendations on mandate delivery sit with the Secretariat and we encourage the Secretary General to implement these without delay. But Member States must also play their part. We must recognise that the United nations mandates and operating model have become unsustainable due to our own actions. By mandating thousands of activities in multiple settings, we have left United nations entities spread too thin and promoted duplication and fragmentation of effort across the United nations system. And we have to recognize that that is in very much part our own responsibility. We need to ensure that we're using UN resources in a coordinated and effective manner. Firstly, we need to show restraint in the activities we mandate. This means being mindful of the costs associated with requesting reports, both commissioning new ones and continuing recurring ones, without clear justification. And this point has already been made several times this morning. We encourage the Secretariat to implement recommendations, to shorten reports, combine reports covering similar issues and explore alternative formats, to present information more concisely and to decrease the burden of reporting and improve overall accessibility. We must also exercise restraint in mandating other activities that have resources. Implications for the United nations budget and at a minimum, be clear on the implications, both monetary and staffing, of delivering the mandate. This includes the proliferation of high level meetings and the agreement to limit the number of such meetings due during High Level Week is a useful start, but we all know that we have started that many times before. We suggest we next consider limiting the number of high level meetings, summits and conferences that are held throughout the year. The forthcoming moratorium on new international days is another useful step, although every one of us in this room knows full well that there's a current rush to approve new ones before the moratorium comes into place. Secondly, where mandates with financial implications are agreed, we need to ensure that the United nations has the financial means to implement it. And to this end, it's essential that Member States pay their assessed contributions in full, on time and without conditions. Our final point is on coherence and coordination, which is a shared responsibility between Member States and the Secretariat. Member States need to take a more coherent approach in our engagement across different multilateral settings and be more aware when we are proposing a mandate that already exists creating duplication across the system. The Secretariat also has a critical role to play in addressing duplication and fragmentation. We encourage the Secretary General to implement recommendations on enhanced strategic oversight and transparency over the United nations system to achieve a better division of labour and allocation of resources to deliver on mandates. We also need to strengthen Member State mechanisms for coordinating our work in the General Assembly. Existing mechanisms such as the General Committee and the Committee on Program Coordination, they are not delivering. We need an honest conversation about how we can do better. Mr. Kamani's briefing this morning highlighted the problem of there being no shared implementation picture across the United Nations. And don't we know that well? We need better centralised knowledge shared between the Secretariat and all Member States to enable us to to better track mandate implementation. Achieving more coherent and integrated mandate delivery across the UN system needs to be a key criterion for considering proposals for structural reform and program realignment under Work Stream 3. We want to see a clearer relationship between effective mandate delivery and any proposed structural reform to enable list. Fundamentally, we want a modern, functional, forward looking organisation with the capacity to deliver high quality results. And the above proposals, which cover both Member State and Secretariat responsibilities, in our view form a series of concrete actions that we can all take towards achieving this. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank Australia. I now give the floor to Romania to be followed by Brazil and then China.

**ROU**, Representative
Thank you very much. Co chairs and I would like to applaud your engagement and your interaction. Excessive outreach you have with Member States and different stakeholders. I think that's very much important. The European Union spoke on some of the key issues. I want to address a couple of them. And building on the comments that our colleague from Liechtenstein, our colleague from Singapore, recently, more recently our colleague from Australia and Barbados have made, you know, the model, the mandate creation is a very important phase. As a matter of fact, we are looking at implementation. We know that the assessment on the implementation is not that positive. The mandate creation is extremely crucial and that's what we are looking at through this revitalization process. Burhan mentioned and talked about the produccity just now. James spoke about the moratorium on international days and weeks. The proof of the efforts is actually easy implementation. We have agreed just now in early September, an important steps that Member States will have to take, some of them transitioning towards the next session, 81st, when the moratorium would actually enter into force for two years on international days and weeks. And we will be trying to, you know, we'll limit. It's a decision to limit the high level meetings during the high level week to three, no more than three. And actually there is no negotiation on this point. You have three. It's a decision, I think it will reflect very badly on Member States not to accept the decision that they haven't taken. Now the trouble that we have, and I cannot escape the feeling that we are moving forward with different speeds. I was monitoring somehow looking at the debates in the main committees on the request from this revitalization resolution on how to organize the debates in the main committees, on the working methods in different committees. And I have that to say that the speed is uneven, the pace is uneven, but also the content and the focus is completely diverse. And probably we'll have to fix that as well, because that's very much linked to the way we implement our points, our resolutions. The periodicity of resolution is so much important. And I very much agree with what Christian has said before. We request by default reports to the Secretary General expecting and knowing that by requesting a report, that item will stay on the agenda. And I also agree with Burhan when saying, and that's what we pointed in the revitalization working group, by simply repeating the same resolution every year doesn't strengthen the validity of that resolution of the mandate as well, but also doesn't facilitate the implementation. And we have to acknowledge that. And that's a good process. The Working Group on Mandate Implementation to acknowledge that important notion. It's something that not very much palpable. It's not a decision. We have to internalize this notion, how this process should go forward. I also want to briefly mention and to applaud the action plan of the Secretary General. We don't see that separately from the work that we are doing. It's a very good work. It somehow encompasses all the work stream that we are looking at with concrete ideas for member states to look at. And from our point of view, this is also a vehicle that would capture and encourage member states to keep along the same, you know, to get the same. To get the same pace. I want to echo Bob's appeal on avoiding this type of ritual exercise, including this meeting as well and many other meetings we have. We have to look at them anew. There is quite a lot of stake and it's not only about the financial reforms of this organization. It's also about the relevance of United nations, how we deliver on all the three pillars. And that's why these conversations are a matter of important. And I will end with that.

Thank you very much. Thank you, Romania. I give the floor now to Brazil, then China and Chile.

**BRA**, Representative
Thank you very much. Dear co chairs, I'm to your very left. Here I am. I'm to your very left. Thank you very much for your fantastic work. Thank you very much for the this meeting. Thank you very much for the briefers from whom I learned very much. I will not read my statement. My expert will forgive me. I will send them to you. But since I have only three minutes, I'd like to accept the invitation that the distinguished Pierromene just made us to be, to change our own ways of doing things, including this meeting, and be as interactive as possible. First of all, and this will be a bit disorganized, but trying to refer to the issue at hand, Brazil will be. Will continue to be very open to considering all good ideas to achieve our collective goals in terms of gaining efficiencies, et cetera. And I tend to agree with most of what has been said here in terms of specific areas to look into to achieve our objective. But at the same time, I think we should be very clear that there are risks along the way. The first risk is for us and Guy Rader mentioned issue of funding and thank you very much, other colleagues. I think Bob mentioned that this is about money. This is about money. And it's, I think, reasonable to believe that if we were not in a liquidity crisis, we'd not be doing what we are doing. But I have said it before and I truly believe that, that it's quite unfortunate that we are going through this process in the middle of a liquidity crisis because obviously the. Even if you have a trillion dollars wasting our taxpayers money is not a good thing to do. So the search for efficiency, for the optimal use of resources, taxpayer money is critical. At the same time, the risk we run doing this in the middle of a liquidity crisis is I think more than twofold. But one is not forgetting why we are in the liquidity crisis. Member states must pay their dues, period. We have to remember that. Secondly, we run the risk of throwing the baby out of the. With the baby water baby, the bath water and this. And part of the problem is that there are many babies in this bathtub and there will be some that will not like some babies that will be some that will like some babies. So the first thing to do is if we are unfortunately throwing out some babies which we don't like, we all hate, that's unhuman or unhumane. But we will have to come to a fair balanced agreement of what we do and what we do not do. For example, limiting the number of high level meetings. It is very likely that some who do not prefer a given issue will not like this issue to be among the 3, 4, 5 high level meetings. Some who love some issues will want probably annual resolutions of that particular issue. And those who do not like that issue will not want annual resolutions. I'm just saying that we have to be fair and we have to be true to ourselves and not naive. And secondly, and finally, yes, I think we have all. We all agree that our methods have become sometimes rigid, ritualistic, etc. But they are there for a reason. They are there for a reason, processes, et cetera. We have to take a fresh look at them all. But again, not believing that one will make a revolution here will not. We know that. And in looking at these methods to search for fairness and balance as we do that. Thank you very much.

**CHN**, Representative
coutures China aligns itself with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of G77 and China. In light of the Secretary General's report and other briefings, I wish to share the following points. First, internal coordination within the Secretariat should be strengthened. The Action Plan for advancing the UN 80 initiative submitted by the Secretary General will help ensure that the UN 80 initiative is implemented in a more substantive and effective manner which China fully supports the action plan, proposes measures to enhance senior management coordination. China looks forward to detailed recommendations in this regard. The UN system comprises more than 140 entities, each of which has its own areas of expertise. We hope that all entities will focus on their core mandates, leverage their competitive strength, minimize duplication of efforts and make the best possible use of the limited resources. Second, meetings and reports should be concrete and concise. There is a broad consensus on the need for the improvement of meetings and reports. China suggests we focus on the following three aspects. First is to adopt a swift, proactive, programmatic and effective working style focusing on improving people's lives. Meetings should start on time and statements and reports should go straight to the points and avoid lengthy and repetitive discussions. Second is to enhance the quality of meetings and reports. The Secretariat has already proposed ideas such as adapting reports formats, enhanced data representation and focus on key issues. We look forward to to detail the plans to translate these ideas into actions and practical proposals for improving meeting and report quality. At the same time, China stress that the importance and value of the UN's report it has provided tremendous insights to the governments, academias, NGOs across the board. Third is to streamline the number of meetings and reports. The Secretariat has established a work package on Secretary General's reports. We hope this mechanism will view review reports with similar content and release time and make specific recommendations for their streamlining. The Secretariat could also provide specific recommendations to Member States on combining meetings, shortening the length of meeting sessions and reducing reviews frequency with a view to achieving tangible results. Third, on funding. Voluntary contributions are an important supplement to the UN's work, but the assessed contributions are the foundation. As the second largest contributor to the UN regular budget, China has always actively fulfilled its financial obligations. We have already fully paid our assessed contributions this year, a total of US$680 million, and we will continue to firmly support the UN and multilateralism through concrete actions. At the same time, we urge the largest contributor to fulfill its own financial obligations. I thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank China for its statement. I give the floor now to Chile and then Switzerland and then the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

**CHL**, Representative
Thank you, Co Chairs. Chile aligns itself with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of the group of 77 and China and with Philippines on behalf of MICS. I also would like to express my appreciation to both of you, the Co Chairs for the organization of the latest briefing and to the panelists for sharing their experiences. An effective and coherent implementation of mandates across the United nations system is fundamental to ensuring that the organizations remain strong agile and credible. For this reason, the implementation stage of the mandate life cycle must be further reinforced and continuously improved. Chile recognized the various challenges that persist during the mandate delivery phase of the life cycle, notably the risks of duplication, misaligned funding modalities, and the excessive volume and duration of meetings and reports, which often outweigh their actual impact. As a former President of ecosoc, I would like to share an example from our work on the 2024 HLPF Ministerial Declaration, which one negotiated must be submitted in parallel to both the General assembly and ECOSOC for adoption in 2024. The submission of an amendment to a vote in the HLPF and the subsequent adoption of the amendment declaration created a lack of clarity on the way forward, as previous practice suggested that the ECOSOC should consider two original text. After initially doing so and following extensive consultations, I ultimately decided to submit to ECOSOC the amended version of the Declaration in order to avoid ending up with two different versions of the same Ministerial Declaration. This example illustrates how procedural arrangement can lead to duplications requiring additional time and resources to resolve matters that should ideally follow a streamlined process. The coordination segment of the ECOSOC itself is a good platform to strengthen the coordination capacity within the Sustainable Development Pillar. The new ECOSOC revision should be coordinated with this work of this Working Group as well. Another challenge lights in the current financial situation of the organization, which continues to erode the capacity of UN entities to fully implement the mandate entrusted to them. These entities face an increasingly difficult environment in this sense, as spending reduction targets further constrain their ability to execute their approved budgets. Decisive and collective action is therefore needed to reverse this trend. Let's turn the funding challenge into an opportunity because, as Brazil mentioned, because even if we had all the money available, we will still need to do this work the way we have been doing its it is losing meaning for the people we are meant to serve. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate our support for the Co Chairs and reaffirm Chile's commitment to engaging constructively in the work of this Working Group. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank Chile. I give the floor to Switzerland and then the Netherlands.

**CHE**, Representative
Co Chairs, colleagues, Switzerland thanks you for your continued leadership. During our tenure as an elected member of the UN Security Council, Switzerland led efforts to establish a resolution on the protection of humanitarian personnel. During the course of the consultation, we reached out to the Secretariat sharing wording suggestions and we were advised that in this particular instance it was preferred preferable to opt for a requirement of regular oral briefings of senior UN officials rather than a regular written report. We took this on board and this helped us to devise the mandate accordingly and go into the direction of effective mandate delivery. This example illustrates what previous briefings have shown in more detail, which is that well crafted mandates are key enablers for effective implementation. Co Chairs allow me to make three points. First, we would like to have clearer understanding of what the Secretary General can already do under his or her own authority, especially to improve delivery management. For example, in a quote, making better use of system wide coordination platforms to avoid duplication, end of quote, such as the Interagency Standing Committee or the CEBU are measures that we believe the SG can already act upon today. Second, regarding meetings and reports, Switzerland supports efforts to reduce their number. Reports should be clearer, shorter, more focused and wherever feasible, reports could be combined. We also encourage the use of different formats such as short update reports instead of lengthy annual documents. In our own system, Swiss diplomats across the world have been instructed to privilege shorter reporting and analysis formats for their daily work, as opposed to more detailed reports at specific situations and for lesser frequency. There is no doubt that we can learn and get inspiration from how the 192 other diplomatic representations and services represented here deal with these very same challenges of information overload, acceleration, limited staffing and so on. Switzerland is also open to exploring technical solutions. Could artificial intelligence tool under human supervision be used to cross check reports for redundancies or provide cross references to related reports? Given the successful experience of setting up the mandate Registry, how about improving the technical interface for reporting by creating an online space that allows for user friendly access to all participants products of existing mandates, taking into consideration multilingualism and accessibility for all. Switzerland, including with our academic partners, stands ready to share its experience in this regard and we take good note of suggestions made earlier, including by Ambassador Kimani and others. Third, and finally, real impact in mandate delivery depends on coordination and tapping into synergies. Efficient mandate delivery requires entities to share knowledge and work hand in hand across UN hubs. Take human rights. The Human Rights Council in Geneva and the General assembly here in New York must operate in lockstep. We gain valuable insights from the Council mandates implementation that are of relevance for our work here. So let's break down silos not only thematically but also geographically. I thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thanks Switzerland. I give the floor now to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, to be followed by Iran and Mexico.

**NLD**, Representative
Thank you and dear co Chairs, I'd like to thank you for your leadership in conducting this intergovernmental process. We welcome the proposed solutions in The Secretary General's report on mandate implementation review. And I'm particularly happy to see USG Ryder here present in this debate the Kingdom of the Netherlands alliance itself with the Statement of the European Union. And I would like to add a few elements in my national capacity. And I would like to focus on three points with regard to recommendations put forward in the SG report. First, regarding prioritization and streamlining meetings and reporting obligations. This requires a clear sense of direction, taking into account what a UN should look like in the future, taking into account the needs of future generations. In particular, we urge the Secretary General to act as swiftly as possible. We consider these recommendations as low hanging fruit and necessary to execute. Given the financial situation the organization is facing. We would encourage the formulation of criteria on the basis of which meetings and reports could be prioritized and streamlined. These criteria in our view could include, for example, relevance and strategic alignment, impact and utilization, duplication and overlap, synergies and integration, potential cost and resource efficiency, legal and political feasibility and digital and procedural efficiency. Secondly, the SG's report contains interesting statistics on mandate delivery, management and coordination. And according to the report and the so called heat map, the risk of duplication in the development cluster is about 51%. And I think we all want to make sure that we increase the impact of our development assistance. And I think that this is a joint commitment that we share. So it should not be a taboo to look at the way to talk about how we do that, how we make sure that we increase the impact by lowering the duplication. And it would be helpful if the Secretary General could provide greater insight into the specific areas where duplication is actually occurring and where positive overlap is also taking place. Third and last, we would be in favor of asking the Secretary General for recommendations on how to further optimize the functioning of existing bodies in coordinating performing the oversight role in the UN mandate delivery. So, for example, we believe optimization could be found in better functioning and cooperation between the Committee of Programming and Coordination, the UN Sustainable Development Group, the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination, the Joint Inspection Unit, the coordination role of the ecosoc and most importantly with a strong two regional bodies and empowered Resident Coordinator system and reconfigured UN country teams. I thank you for your attention.

**IRN**, Representative
Thank you, Madam Chair. At the outset we thank you for convening this meeting which provides an opportunity to exchange views on enhancing the delivery and coherence of United Nations Mandates the Islamic Republic of Iran aligns itself with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of Group 77 and China. We recognize that the proposals on the demanded delivery aims at enhancing efficiency and effectiveness through streamlining the meetings and reporting process, make funding mechanism more impactful and less fragmentation and enhanced coherence and coordination. We attach great importance to ensuring that the implementation of mandates is fully aligned with nationally defined development priorities. Such alignment is essential to achieve tangible and sustainable results that respond to the realities and aspirations of Member States and offer greater likelihood of success in this regard. We believe that the successful implementation of mandates must be accompanied by systematic investment in institutional and human capacity in developing countries. Any reduction in resources could constrain training programs, capacity building initiatives and the transfer of technology, thereby weakening our collective ability to address global challenges effectively. The role of regional and sub regional structures is also indispensable for ensuring responsiveness and inclusiveness in mandate delivery. The preservation and adequate resourcing of regional commissions and field offices are vital to enable them to respond effectively to regional priorities and specific local contexts. Downsizing or reducing staff in these offices would risk eroding institutional memory and limiting the ability of developing countries to access timely and equitable support from the UN system. Further, we stressed that the Secretariat should maintain a neutral and balanced role in implementing mandates and supporting Member States in achieving their objectives. We also underscore that the UN entities must operate within the parameters set by Member States, adhering strictly to intergovernmentally agreed language and avoiding any perception of Secretariat driven initiatives. We believe this approach is essential for preserving the credibility and technical integrity of Secretariat's work. Finally, we encourage enhanced transparency and regular update on the status of mandate implementation, including clear explanations for any non or partial implementation. We believe that mandates should be treated fairly and for the benefit of the entire membership. Comprehensive information sharing will enable Member States to identify gaps, improve coordination and ensure that the organization's work remains guided by the collective priorities of all members in an efficient and effective manner. Thank you, Madam Chair.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished representative of Iran. And I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Mexico, to be followed by Argentina.

**MEX**, Representative
Thank you for giving me the floor, Madam Chair. Mexico expresses its gratitude to the Co Chairs for their dedicated leadership and reference its support for the proposals. But forward in the Secretary's General Report, Co Chairs allow me to outline four proposals Mexico believes are relevant for our collective exchange on the implementation phase of the mandate life cycle. First, breaking counterproductive practices. Our long standing practice of layering new directions upon existing ones without allowing Time to fully implement or assess them has generated an accumulation of tasks, overlapping duplications and bottlenecks. A prudent cooling off period would enable mandates to be properly implemented before new decisions are introduced on the symptomatic area. This will help restore coherence and prevent the continuous pileup of paragraphs, requests and reporting lines that ultimately hinder the purpose they seek to advance. Second, a forward looking approach Implementation should not be conceived in isolation from evaluation. A preventive system wide mindset, one that anticipates how a mandate will be assessed, must guide the design and implementation of activities. Ensuring alignment between objectives, indicators and institutional capacities is the only way to secure relevance, pertinence and meaningful impact. 3. Strengthening coherence Improving implementation requires system wide solutions. We propose developing a centralized and transparent architecture for mandate implementation. A dedicated implementation section in the UN Mandate Source Registry should be established to enhance accounting interpretability, prevent unintentional duplication and enable evidence based decision making. It would allow identifying the responsible entity, expected deliverables, timelines, resource requirements and potential overlap with existing tasks. At the organizational level, the Committee on Program and Coordination CPC is the bridge between mandates and programs. It is the institutional body specifically designed to ensure coherence and coordination during implementation. Strengthening and modernizing the CPC must be central component of the UN reform. This requires elevating the level and quality of its deliberations and outcomes and enhancing its visibility according to its responsibility. Fourth, and lastly, clarity and continuity. Persistent inconsistencies in the interpretation of mandates, combined with dispersed institutional memory and internal coordination across the system, have undermined coherent implementation among agencies. The Secretariat should be equipped and authorized to provide formal system wide interpretative guidance on mandates, especially when discrepancies or ambiguities arise. A strengthened duty to warm Mechanism will be enabled to Secretariat to alert Member States when a mandate contradicts an existing instruction, exceeds available capacities or risk duplication. I thank you, Madam Chair. I thank the distinguished representative of Mexico and I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of Argentina to be followed by ourselves.

**ARG**, Representative
Salvador, thank you. Thank you very much. Good morning all Protocol observes. So allow me to share some inputs from our point of view and we will try to follow some of the items in the Secretary General's report on this. So when it comes to proliferation of meetings and reports, we believe that this is an area we could have impactful changes immediately regarding the report proliferation. We agree that there is a report proliferation in terms of quantity and length. This proliferation undermines also the quality of reports and we are supportive of the idea of Shorter reports that maintain a high quality, a level of high quality. Many annual reports could be issued every two or three years. Indeed, but there is no one size fits all on this we should assess the merit. But also the different dynamics on the different UN bodies. It's not the same dynamic in the Security Council, the ecosocial, the General assembly, even its committee have different dynamics. And if we go to the whole UN system, I mean different governing bodies have different dynamics. So it's a challenging process. Maybe to reduce the quantity of reports, the idea of joint reports could be explored among the several structures of the UN system. Regional perspective could be also integrated in a single report. And this idea of joint reports should not undermine the different views that the system might have on the same issue. Also, reports by thematic clusters could be explored based on the work organization of each committee of the General assembly or in the dynamics of each body regarding meetings proliferation, we see this as a problem that within the UN system that we could resolve shortly if we have political will. It's a collective responsibility, as we said, among Member states, but also among the Secretariat. In our view, part of this problem of the proliferation of meeting is closely related to the over dimension and proliferation of certain political agendas within the UN system. As we said before, we need a realistic diagnostic on this issue. And it's not only a problem with the quality, with the quantity, but also with the quality of meetings, because in the long term dilutes the quality of interaction between Member states. And we see also as part of this problem the proliferation of parallel meeting and processes or Secretary initiatives that do not have intergovernmental mandates that are also part of this proliferation meeting. When it comes to, I would say delivery, management and coordination. I mean, the issue of fragmentation, overlap, duplication, as has been said, is more a comprehensive discussion. But the way maybe of citing mandates along the UN entities when it comes to program at budget is something that needs to be improved and revisit maybe also the discussion on the role of the cpc. But we have seen in the reports that more than 20 entities are putting budget implications with the same mandate. So when we create a mandate, we should maybe evaluate a specific assignment for an entity to be the primary responsible for implementation, or maybe give to the Secretary General the prerogative to indicate which entity should coordinate that. And maybe when we set, when we give broad mandates or open mandates, I've seen many resolutions we request the UN system to do this. Maybe that should be avoided because not only generates duplication and fragmentation, but also competition for resources and to finalize link this with the idea of funding. I mean the discussion around funding. We see this also a part of a link between some over dimension agendas, fragmentation of the UN system and funding modalities that at some point are in our view undermining the core mandate that the United nations should have. I thank you,

**SLV**, PR
Thank you very much. Madam Co Chair. My delegation align itself with the statements that were delivered previously by Iraq and the Philippines and in national capacity. We would like to mention the following Co Chairs. Mandate implementation, as we have been expressing before, is not an abstract notion. It is actually the day to day, day to day work that translate the intergovernmental decisions into concrete impact. So therefore, the efforts to strengthen efficiency, we believe that must not be equated with reducing programmatic ambition. Rather, they should focus on refining the mechanisms, processes and also the resources necessary to ensure full and timely implementation. So efficiency must enhance delivery, not dilute the mandates. And in that sense, our delegation is really open to discuss some measures that have been previously expressed, like the length of the reports that we definitely agreed and also the discussion, periodic discussions. In the same manner. Addressing fragmentation during implementation cannot be limited to a funding discussion. For us, it requires a serious examination of coordination across the UN system. So fragmentation is often felt mostly in the field, where the overlaps and duplications can hinder coherence. It can also complicate partnerships and reduce the quality of support provided to the governments. And in that sense, an honest field based assessment of these dynamics is essential to improving the mandate delivery. We are concerned by the competition for resource among entities. This is nothing new. Other delegations have also mentioned and this should never compromise the quality, consistency and also the credibility of the UN presence on the ground. And Member States have the responsibility to ensure that the system function precisely as a system, not as a collection of competing institutions. We emphasize that increased flexibility in redeploying resources can only be contemplated if delegations have a clear common understanding of its scope and also the limit limitations. So flexibility Co Chairs cannot become a substitute for proper oversight. It must operate strictly within the frameworks that safeguard full accountability. So any discussions on optimizing restricting the existing structures must take into account the distinct mandates, working methods, timelines of entities, and also the headquarters in Vienna, Geneva and and idobi. Because these differences matter. Yes, they shape operational realities and therefore require a tailored and thoughtful consideration. So close consultations with their secretariats is crucial. If we are to achieve coherence and also a comprehensive outcome. Co Chairs allow me to conclude with a simple through our biggest challenge do not come from lack of rules, but from lack of implementation and also a sustained engagement by Member States. And the reason why I'm saying this is if the agreements of the GA revitalization process were applied were rigor, we will not be debating mandate accumulation or work cycle pressure today. So these lessons must inform precisely the UN 80 initiative because when Member States engage seriously and follow through, the revitalization delivers true results. So El Salvador definitely will continue supporting you Co Chairs and we support any approach that definitely delivers and change over current situation. Thank you very much.

**PRY**, PR
Good morning to everyone. My delegation wishes to express its recognition, appreciation and full support for the work carried out by you both, Brian and Carolyn, as a co facilitator, we truly value your constructive efforts in this process. Turning to step two on Monday Delivery, we consider this discussion essential to strengthening the United nations capacity to deliver effectively and currently on hinge mandates, we took note of the three main challenges that continue to hinder mandate delivery and reduce our collective impact according to the Secretary General report. First, we are really worried as a small mission, as many other delegations in this room, about the growing number of meeting and length reports. We are really worried this situation has created an administrative burden that often outweigh the benefits. Many reports are not only long but also repetitive and rarely consult to tackle. This preparation is key and in that sense we suggest establishing a system that identifies which meeting reports at a greatest strategic value, suspend or merge those that are redundant and optimize report format with clear length limits. Once again, we support the secure and responsible use of artificial intelligence to help summarize, translate and link related reports, making information more accessible and cost efficient. Second, regarding the management of mandate delivery, stating that there is still a lack of clarity in how responsibilities are divided which lead to duplication and efficiency. According to point number 41 of the report, existing oversight in the United nations system focuses mainly on program planning, budgets and operational issues of individual United nations entities in isolation, rather than seeking to ensure strategic alignment across the system to drive impact and efficiency. To overcome this, we support the idea of having a centralized oversight mechanism within the Secretariat to monitor coherence across man mandates and we see value in establishing permanent interagency coordination platform to ensure better collaboration across entities. Third, with regard the misaligned funding modalities. We encourage the proposed solution to fully apply all commitments by Member States and the United nations system through the founding compact and strengthened dialogue. To this end couture, we need to be pragmatic and we believe this practical step could make mandate delivery more current, efficient and aligned with our shared vision of a stronger multilateral system, one that delivers real results for people and communities on the ground. And finally, we wish to underline the need for greater and better better coordination with the Secretariat so that its perspective and concerns are heard and seriously considered. Especially since the implementation of mandate relies heavily on their daily work. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished Permanent Representative of Paraguay. And I now give the floor to the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation, to be followed by the United States. United States.

**RUS**, Representative
Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to say that we support the practical steps to improve coordination and efficiency in the delivery of mandates. Existing interagency platforms can be used more effectively to reduce duplication while respecting the independent and mandates of each entity and division of labor. I think a lot of delegations speak to this end today. At the same time, Russia cannot agree with proposals that would expand the Secretariat's autonomy in prioritizing or streamlining mandated activities. Decisions of priority must remain with the Member States. Financial operational considerations cannot justify the modification, delay or non implementation of mandates adopted by intergovernmental organs. I would echo what Mr. Ray said about the money and this position. To all questions, the answer is money is as old as our Bible, the book of Ecclesiastes. But still we think that we should not allow, as they say, the tail wag the dog. And the Member States have to finally determine what they want and then decide how to provide for it. We are concerned by suggestions to to shorten, merge or reprioritize mandated reports. We totally agree we should have shorter resolutions, but we don't agree we should have shorter reports. Reporting is essential accountability and transparency tool and must remain comprehensive, accurate and accessible. Moreover, the UN 80 is an initiative which is a good opportunity to instruct the UN Secretary General to improve the quality of the Secretary General reports by addressing the issue of methodology of report preparation. In particular, we are very concerned about the sources of information which become, so to say, legitimized by the Secretary General reports. And of course, these improvements must go hand in hand with enhanced methodology for the Secretariat's self evaluation of mandate delivery, which needs to be reflected. And special attention should be given to the sources of information as well as separate review of mandates that are delivered at the cost of voluntary contributions, especially with the information that we have reconfirmed today by Guy Ryder by the amount of voluntary contributions. Proposals to align or redeploy resources internally without the approval of the General assembly would undermine the budgetary prerogatives of the member states. Russia also stresses that we cannot support the reference in the Secretary General reports to the Resident Coordinator system as a successful tool of strengthening internal oversight of the UN division of labor. I think that there are a lot of challenges to this so called successes. Thank you very much.

**USA**, Representative
Thank you Co chairs and colleagues. I'm inspired by the remarks of our distinguished colleague who's retiring, the permanent representative from Canada. I think his remarks were spot on and in the spirit of honoring that and being very inspired by what he said, I'm going to throw out most of what I wrote here because it's duplicative of what many of you, almost all of you have said here this morning. Not everyone. Some people like long reports. Some people like overlapping mandates, Some people like spending money on paper in meetings instead of impact on the ground. But I would say that if we took a poll amongst this room, reforming how we write and implement mandates would have more popularity than ice cream. And ice cream is pretty popular. So I'm going to throw out my remarks and make one general point and two specific points. I submit. We submit that efficient and effective delivery and measurable impact should be at the heart of everything we do in our work here at the United Nations. And it's worth noting that in 2024 alone we spent, the United nations spent $360 million on the direct costs, meetings and reports. Let me repeat that in case it wasn't clear. $360 million not on maintaining and promoting international peace and security or providing life saving aid, but on meetings and reports. And These reports are 40% longer than they were 20 years ago. Now if anyone can show me that we are 40% more useful, insightful and actionable because of these reports, are we achieving better, faster or smarter decisions because of these 40% increase in the reports? I'll buy dinner. But I don't think you're going to be able to prove that. So this is great and I really appreciate the hard work and focus of the co chairs. We are fully, we the United States, stand ready to work with every member state and with the co Chairs who are focused on this most important and critical work But I would ask you, as you leave here today and get ready for a nice weekend, if we're all agreeing, or almost all of us are agreeing that this needs to happen, then let's make it happen. We don't need four hour meetings and lots of talking in the halls. Let's get this going and we stand ready to support and help Co Chairs in anything you need to put this into action. Thank you so much for your hard work.

Croatia aligns itself with the statement delivered by the European Union on behalf of its Member States and I would like to add a few remarks in my national capacity. We welcome the continued focus on mandate implementation as noted in the previous meeting and reflected in the Secretary General's report on Stream 2. Three key concerns the proliferation of meetings and reports, the inadequate management of mandate delivery and misaligned funding modalities. We share these concerns. However, we wish to emphasize that many of these issues stem from the way mandates are created. As we stressed previously, mandates must be concise, clear and purpose driven to ensure effective implementation. Mandates should also be flexible enough to allow the Secretary General and the UN management to allocate responsibility to in the most efficient manner without micromanagement from Member States. In this period, we underline four key points. First, clarity of scope and objectives. Mandates should establish measurable goals aligned with strategic priorities to reduce overlap and sharpen focus. 2. Integrated delivery frameworks we support the SGE's proposal for common administrative platforms and consolidated functions to unify efforts and reduce fragmentation across UN entities. 3. Enhanced field level Coordination Coordination must improve not only at the country level but also regionally to ensure mandates are context sensitive and impactful. Data driven monitoring and robust metrics and real time reporting will support adaptive implementation. 4. Flexible funding with accountability Member States should uphold the Funding Compact and enable the Secretariat to redeploy resources swiftly, especially to safeguard essential country level delivery. This flexibility must be paired with accountability and transparent justification. In conclusion, effective mandate implementation begins with thoughtful mandate design. By ensuring mandates are strategic, streamlined and supported by flexible systems, we can empower the UN to deliver with greater coherence and impact. Thank you.

I thank the distinguished Representative of Croatia. I give the floor now to Japan to be followed by Vietnam and Timor Lest.

**JPN**, Representative
Thank you Co Chair and thank you Brief for their insightful and informative briefings. Japan would like to make three comments regarding this mandate Delivery Phase first, we encourage the Secretary General to make full use of his authority as the Chief Administrative Officer to move forward on areas where action can be taken without delay in order to avoid duplication and ensuring strategic and coherent use of resources across the UN system. Some of those concrete measures in this regard were mentioned in the SG report, so I don't repeat here. Second, as for the actions requiring the approval by Member States, Japan welcomed concrete proposals such as streamlining meeting schedules and reducing the volume of reports, and we have already been and will continue to be flexible in accommodating the Secretariat's concrete proposal in this regard. Finally, regarding the proposal on the flexible funding, we recognize the need for greater flexibility to respond to emergencies and unforeseen circumstances. At the same time, we wish to emphasize that it is necessary to examine whether the flexible funding proposal by the Secretariat will lead to improved efficiency in mandatory implementation. Furthermore, for voluntary contributions, alike assessed contributions, a high level of accountability to the Member States is required. In other words, it is important to ensure that funding mechanism preserves the incentive for donor countries to make contributions. Therefore, we believe that such discussions should take place in existing forums involving the relevant Member States and UN entities, and we stand ready to continue participating them. I thank you, I thank the distinguished representative of Japan.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I give the floor now to Vietnam to be followed by Timor Lest and then Saudi Arabia.

**VNM**, Representative
Thank you very much. Co Chairs, I I thank you for all your efforts and I thank also the briefers for the very nice presentations. Allow me to just make two points and both of them in fact are a bit related to money. Number one is there's a narrative that the UN80 process is caused by or driven by the lack of money. I beg to differ a bit because I believe that the need to change, the need for reform, is a constant desire that we have had for many, many years. An example is the Delivering as One initiative which has been piloted since 2007 in a set of seven countries. And there are a lot that have been done and a lot that have changed and driven change. So the current crisis may give us a stronger push, a sense of urgency. But I believe that this must remain a long term endeavor for all of us. After, after UN80, there will have to be UN90, UN100 and beyond. So that's the first point I wanted to make. Second, I wanted to emphasize and focus on funding. We get what we fund. The current situation is that funding is more short term than strategic, it creates more competition than coherence, and it is often in most Cases more driven by individual donor priorities rather than collective commitments. Now my experience at the country level has been that, you know, when I ask for funding for certain activities, when it comes to gender equality, women, peace and security, there's plenty of that. But if I ask for funding for a child rights event or an agricultural event, it's very hard to find the funding. So it's not meeting the needs of the country where the UN is operating. And it is because of the funding fragmentation. And I really liked how the SG puts it in the report which says fragmentation and funding leads to fragmentation in implementation. And I think it's critical that we change this pattern of funding. We have to encourage more multi year unearmarked funding and it may be useful to revisit the role and the effectiveness of pooled funding mechanisms that we had in the past, including the MDG Fund, the Multi Partner Trust Fund, and also revisit the lessons learned from the various reform initiatives that we have had. And finally, because we are talking about short term meetings, I encourage you to have a MIC cutoff enforcement in your upcoming meetings. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you. I give the floor now to Timur Leste followed by Saudi Arabia.

**TLS**, Ambassador
Thank you Co Chair. Just to be very brief, we commend your hard work and we share most of the opinions that actually being shared across this room. Just want to make a few points from a programmatic standpoint and take into account the financial shortcomings. I think we need to actually concentrate on certain programmatic issues when it comes to this reform apart from what has been said in the report of the the Secret General at first I think we need to look into the mandate cycle design, life cycle design. Second, I think we need to actually also look into the coherence in terms of programmatic architecture, the issue of like merging and no repetition and so on. And then the third point is on the operational alignment, particularly in the use of data driven systems, shared platforms and interoperable tools to elevate programmatic delivery rather than merely administrative efficiency. And then we also actually have to I think take into account the adaptive programming, particularly in terms of mandates and programs that have to be responsive and evolving with the evolving realities. And also looking into issues of capacity building, localization, particularly in the last developed countries. In summary co chairs, just to comply with what my colleague from Vietnam has said, I mean the UN 80 program agenda is about doing things differently, differently. So not simply doing the same things with less, but structuring programs so that they are coherent, outcome oriented, integrated, adaptable and designed for hanover it's about shifting from an organization where mandates accumulate to one where programs deliver and transition. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished Ambassador of Timor Leste and I'll give the floor to the distinguished PR of Saudi Arabia to be followed by Ecuador and then the UK

**SAU**, Representative
Excellency is distinguished delegates. My delegation alliance itself itself with the statements made by Iraq on behalf of the G77 and China and by Kuwait on behalf of the GCC Co chairs, we wish to express our sincere appreciation for your wise leadership in guiding the work of the informal ad hoc working group and for convening this meeting to consider the second phase of the mandate review cycle. We also appreciate the efforts made in preparing in preparing the Secretary General's report on this matter, which provided a clear overview of the challenges in this era. Along with a set of recommendations Co chairs, the report identifies major challenges hindering effective mandate implementation, including overlapping, excessive meetings and reports, procedural complexity and weak institutional coordination. In return, the report proposed set of solutions such as simplifying procedures, reducing duplication in meetings and reports and strengthening coordination among UN entities. In this context, we view the proposed recommendations positively and we would like to put forward a couple of practical measures to strengthening implementation of mandates. These measures include forming coordination team among UN agencies with similar mandates to develop joint implementation plans as well as streamlining meetings with similar topics. Additionally, employing artificial intelligence to analyze reports and monitor commitments can help build an integrated database on the mandate's implementation. Co Chairs. In conclusion, we wish to reiterate that the success of this second phase of the mandate review cycle depends on on a realistic and comprehensive approach that enhances the effectiveness of the UN system and delivers tangible results. My delegation reaffirmed its commitment to support efforts to develop practical mechanisms that strengthen mandate implementation and the objectives of the UN Charter. I thank you. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished Permanent Representative of Saudi Arabia. I give the floor to the distinguished PR of Ecuador.

**ECU**, PR
I thank you. And I thank the Cocheres for their leadership and their briefers for their insightful feedback. I also value the Secretary General's proposals, especially those focused on streamlining reports and meetings, leveraging digital tools and enhancing internal coordination. Every resource saved should be redirected to concrete action. Colleagues, within the allocated three minutes, allow me once again to briefly speak about my experience as President of the Executive Board of undp, UNFPA and unops. By the way, with some reluctance, but with final understanding of the rationale behind it, we managed to cut off the MIC after three minutes. So feel free to do it with me if I exceed that time. There, in our Board, we have prioritized efficiency by reducing official sessions, improving coherence in decision making and generating savings that benefit the organization. We have also worked to ensure that the decisions adopted by our Board are as coherent and implementable as possible and based on the Agency's mandates. Of note, this year, in my capacity as President of the Triple Board, I visited Panama, Jordan and Egypt where I observed the tangible impact of UN initiative initiatives from watershed management and refugee health services to climate adaptation and food security. These experiences convince me that our success is measured not by reports, but by real improvements in people's lives in some of the most challenging contexts. Understanding operations on the ground helps identify synergies and prevent duplication, fostering complementarity rather than competition as we move forward and to improve mandate implementation. One of the goals of this exercise should be to identify and agree on practical ways to operationalize deeper collaboration across entities, including through shared back office functions, joint digital hubs and other integrated services. We should also aim at strengthening the current oversight mechanisms in place. On funding we recognize that reliance on voluntary and earmarked contributions has increased fragmentation and limited strategic capacity. Predictable funding is essential. Ultimately the our aim is not to do more with less, but to achieve greater efficiency. Modernizing our approach to maximize impact the challenge before us is on how to install a state of the art software on a heavy hardware. Thank you very much. I thank the distinguished PR of Ecuador.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I give the floor now to the United States Kingdom and just before she takes the floor let me advise we do have a number of other requests for the floor so we will be reconvening at3.uk you have the floor.

**GBR**, Representative
Thank you Co Chairs and thank you to Jamaica and New Zealand for your continued leadership of this ad hoc working group and for the transparency and inclusiveness of of the process that you're running. The United Kingdom reaffirms our strong support for the UNAT Initiative and the Secretary General's efforts to promote coherence, efficiency and effectiveness across the UN's three core pillars. As this Working Group considers principles that could apply to future mandates, we again underscore the need to set the bar high, ensuring we reduce duplication and free up resources to better deliver priorities. This will reduce the burden on all of us as Member States, but even more critically on the UN Secretariat if we improve the focus, specificity and timelines of mandates for the UN Secretariat, strengthening internal strategic coordination is essential to reducing duplication and enhancing delivery, ensuring work is assigned to the most appropriate entity. This could be led by EOSG working in coordination with the cpc and in that regard I want to build on questions and comments made by others around understanding the SG's authority in this space. On meetings and reports, much has been said, but from a UK perspective we support the streamlining of reports and meetings, including by reducing their length and frequency, as well as considering alternative formats. But procedural reforms have their limits. Proliferation is best addressed at inception and this requires collective discipline for us as Member States when we're creating these mandates. Finally, on funding, adequate funding is critical to mandate implementation and as ever, this issue is best addressed by Member States paying assessed contributions in full and on time and without conditions. With regards to voluntary funding, I was struck by USG Rider's slide around small grants and the administrative burden related to that and that point is well made and I think on pooled funding the UK is very much in support of pooled funding, specifically in the humanitarian space. Finally, we welcome the recent issuance of the UNAT Work Plan and hope that this will help build the links between the three work strands. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the United Kingdom. I give the floor to Cuba.

**CUB**, Representative
Thank you Co Chairs, we appreciate this news opportunity to discuss proposals regarding the implementation of mandates under the UN 80 initiative. Cuba aligns itself with the Declaration of Iraq on behalf of the Group of USD and China and would like to make the following observations in national capacity. We emphasize that as stated in the follow up information to the consultation on October 30, decisions on which reports should be prioritized, combined or simplified must be studied on case by case basis, taking into account the level of political sensitivity and consequently the volume of information needed for the consideration of a given issue. We also believe that the Unity Initiative is an opportunity to improve the report preparation process, including the review of information sources and other aspects that contribute to the reports providing a comprehensive reflection of reality. Co Chairs, we recognize the need to advance in the search of efficiencies that will enable the entities to across the system to be in a better position to fulfill their mandate. However, we do not favor the relocation of resources without the proper approval of the General Assembly. A clear definition of what it meant by reasonable justification is needed as granting in a given entity greater flexibility under such an ambiguous term could lead to arbitrary decisions. In that case, the prerogative of Member States will be relegated. Furthermore, we reiterate that we have doubts about how to approach these proposals given that the budget responds to a program plan previously defined by the Member States. Thank you so much.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you Cuba. I give the floor to the distinguished DPR of France, who will be the final speaker in the this morning's session.

**FRA**, DPR
Thank you Mr. Co Chair and all protocol observes. I'll do the short version of my speech and to add three remarks in complement of the European Union statement with which France aligns itself. First, we fully support the implementation of leaner, clearer and more agile mandate delivery process. This starts with the assignment of tasks. We strongly encourage the Security Secretary General to designate a single lead entity for mandate implementation each time mandates allow it. Second, we need to frame our dialogue on mandate financing around increased responsibility and flexibility. As Member States, we have a double responsibility. First, to honor our financial commitments in time and in full, but second, to acknowledge that some mandates can actually be implemented within existing resources and some of them require additional resources. And on the second point, I think our discussions show that we need to have more regular exchanges with the Secretariat on the funding of mandates, and France would support exploring avenues for more flexible use of resources by the Secretariat in order to make the best possible use of the organization's workload absorption capacity. Third, and finally, France calls for an enhanced dialogue between Member States and the Secretariat on mandate results, performance and evaluation. During a previous meeting and also today, USG Guy Rider shared insightful information on the organization's marginal costs for additional reports or additional meetings, which could provide a useful starting point in this regard. Benchmarks with other international organizations could be mobilized, for example, for the presentations. Sorry, in the presentations by Secretary to this ad hoc working group and for example on AI in interpretation, which is widely used at the European Parliament or for some international conferences to end, France remains fully committed to supporting the Secretary General's drive forward on this important work stream. Tetra finances.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the distinguished DPR of France who was the last speaker in this session. We will resume at 3 to hear the remaining speakers. The meeting is adjourned.

## Session 6: Continued Review Discussion (Nov 14 Part 2, 2025)
Video: /video/k1q/k1q3djbdxu

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
Colleagues, can I ask you to take your seats as I call to order this meeting of the informal Ad hoc Working Group on Mandate Implementation Review. We will resume where we Left off at 1 o' clock today with the remaining list of speakers, and I will begin by giving the floor to the representative of Costa Rica.

**CRI**, Representative
Thank you very much. Dear co facilitators, Co chairs, I'm sorry. It's great to see you coordinating our works and congratulations from my delegation for all the work you have done so far. Excellencies, Dear distinguished colleagues, we are operating in a context of growing financial pressures that affect the predictability required for effective mandate delivery. This reality underscores the need to strengthen responsible financing, governance and administration so that the United nations can continue to fulfill the mandates entrusted to it. Mandate implementation is where credibility is tested. Allow me to highlight three points and four possible step forwards. First, the reporting burden continues to expand, largely because we Member States continue to request new reports. Costa Rica supports a careful review of periodicities, duplications and mandates whose reporting requirements may be no longer necessary. The goal is to improve the quality, usefulness and timeliness of reporting. While each committee has its own dynamics, more deliberate planning and sequencing of meeting time between bureaus and the Secretariat can support more effective workload management, acknowledging that only part of the cost structure is truly adjustable. Second, a more coherent United nations requires stronger system wide coordination. Clarifying the division of labor on the basis of comparative advantage can reduce overlap and increase impact. For Costa Rica, this must be guided by transparent and more inclusive intergovernmental oversight across the UN system as a whole, particularly in the funds and programs and within the governance of their executive boards. Coordination efforts should respect established governance arrangements while also identifying areas where those arrangements could be refined to support more coherent planning and delivery. Third, mandate implementation, budgeting and liquidity are inseparable. Persistent cash constraints require responsible forms of flexibility within existing governance frameworks. Better internal reprogramming, a better a more strategic use of existing reserve and more coherent resource planning across related clusters can help sustain operations and reduce fragmentation. Pool or joint mechanisms may also help reduce structural competition for resources. Looking ahead, Costa Rica supports first, a focused mandate implementation dialogue, a more comprehensive one and a continuous one. Second, evidence based reviews of reporting cycles. Third, assessments of the cost implications of different reporting and meeting models, modalities and fourth, an annual exchange with the Secretariat to better align mandates, capacities and resources. Costa Rica remains committed to a United nations that is coherent, efficient and capable of delivering the results that the international community expects. I thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank Costa Rica. I give the floor now to Indonesia and then we will have Germany, Algeria, Kyrgyzstan, Senegal and Norway. Indonesia, you have the floor.

**IDN**, Representative
Thank you. Co Chairs Indonesia extends appreciation to you for the inclusive, transparent and constructive engagement in the continuation of this process. We also thank all briefers for the responses and also for the presentation last week. Today's discussion on mandate implementation is among the utmost importance of the overall process. This is the point where decisions taken are translated into real change on the ground. It is where expectations must turn into action and where the true effectiveness of the United nations is ultimately measured. Allow us to share our two key reflections on today's topic. First, on the design of the reports. From the last briefing, we noted a persistent pattern that a significant portion of reports are recurring, yet those do not always yield new or meaningful values. Indonesia believes that future reports must shift from repetition to relevance and offering deeper insights in a more comprehensive and measurable way. In this regard, we are of the view that areas of improvement could be applied to the report designs, such as maintaining a similar structure of reports on targeted focus with updated contents in its issuance of reports, that this will enable us to track progress and identify gaps. Meanwhile, emerging issues could be highlighted in a separate chapter with brief details. Second, on the issue of overlapping mandate citations, while entities might cite similar mandates, a similar citation does not necessarily mean similar implementation in practice. Entities may apply the same mandate to different regions, constituencies or operational contexts. We therefore need a mechanism that traces the end use of these mandates, clarifying what activities are undertaken, where they occur and with what concrete impacts. The function parameters presented in the response to the last briefing, ranging from normative support and policy advice to data capacity building and service delivery, could be a starting point as practical tools to map complementarities and reduce unnecessary duplication. Co Chairs to conclude, rest assured that Indonesia stands ready to engage constructively to ensure mandate implementation remains purposeful, coherent and impactful. Thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank Indonesia. Give the floor now to Germany and then Algeria.

**DEU**, Representative
Co Chairs Colleagues, Germany fully aligns with the statement made by the EU this morning. We thank you again, Co Chairs, for your leadership and for organizing the very insightful briefing on mandate implementation. Building on what we learned from our great briefers, I would like to make three points in my national capacity. First, on reports and meetings. As others have already outlined, we also think that we need to address the proliferation of meetings and reports. Since 1990, the amount of reports has increased by about 20%. Why not, as a first step, cut the comparable 20% and get back to the level of 9090 when it comes to the amount of reports. Secondly, on internal oversight, one important task is to address the poor division of labor within the UN system that can lead to duplication and also to the misallocation of funds. We should strengthen the internal strategic planning and where appropriate, accompanied by independent internal and external oversight. The goal should be to ensure that UN entities only work on implementation of those mandates for which they have tangible comparative advantages and of course, in a well coordinated manner. Thirdly, and lastly, Co Chairs, let me make a broader point on the UNH spirit. Germany very much appreciates the deliberations and the exchange in this Working Group under the able leadership of you, dear Co Chairs. If we want the reform to be successful, we as Member States need to fully embrace the Unit spirit. Also, outside this room and this Working Group, the current Committee season provides the perfect opportunity to do so. For instance, in the First Committee, France and Germany made some proposals how to make the work in that Committee more efficient. Specific ideas include reduced time for statements and meetings and only submitting draft resolutions if there is a substantial change. That's just one example. I'm sure other delegations and other committees might come up with even better and bolder ideas. But that kind of practical application could in turn feed back into this room and this Working Group. By that, we, the Member States, could fully embrace the UNAT spirit in our everyday Committee work and of course, continue our work here in the Working Group, aiming at high ambitious results under your leadership. I thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank Germany for its statement. I give the floor now to Algeria, followed by Kyrgyzstan.

**DZA**, Representative
Thank you for giving me the floor. Algeria aligns itself with the statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of G77 and China and welcomes the opportunity to engage constructively in the ongoing discussions on unity. We share the collective aspiration for a United nations that is more coherent, more coordinated and more responsive. In this regard, we have taken note of proposals that could allow the Secretariat to set or adjust priorities on the basis of internal consideration. We wish to reiterate that the strategic direction of the Organization is determined exclusively by Member States. Mandates, whether political, peacekeeping, humanitarian or development related, cannot be recalibrated due to financial constraints or operational pressures. Their implementation is not discretionary, nor can it be delayed or reshaped outside of intergovernmental decisions. We also recognize the value of enhancing efficiency and fostering innovation in reporting and resolution making. However, these efforts must not weaken Member States ability to exercise their work. What is required is improved analytical depth, clearer methodologies for the preparation of reports, more rigorous self evaluation by the Secretariat and increased transparency. We need to make the best of the accumulated institutional knowledge that the organization has gathered through its 80 years of existence. Furthermore, reforms that affect Africa must be undertaken in close consultation with African states, the African Union, and regional organizations that hold direct responsibilities in peace, security and development on the continent. Inclusion and partnership are indispensable for a credible and sustainable reform process. In this regard, we caution against any measures that could negatively impact peace, security and development in Africa, and recall that the United nations bears a historical responsibility toward the continent, one that this reform process must uphold and strengthen, not depart from. Finally, we underscore the importance of Excuse me, we underscore the importance of maintaining coherence across all UNH work streams. Decisions taken in one area, whether structural, operational or budgetary, inevitably affect mandate implementation in others. To avoid fragmented or unintended outcomes, the process must be considered and managed holistically, with a full appreciation of its interdependences. Thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank Algeria for her statement. I give the floor now to Kyrgyzstan and then Senegal.

**KGZ**, Representative
Thank you. Co Chairs Excellencies. Let me begin by thanking the Co Chairs for convening this important meeting and for their continued efforts to advance the reform of the United Nations. Today, the United nations stand at a decisive moment. The UNAT reform must be more than an administrative exercise. It must help the organization act faster, work smarter and deliver better Results. With the UN system resources expected to decrease by almost 1/4 by 2026, we cannot afford excessive bureaucracy. We must focus on what truly effective, coordinated and accountable implementation of mandates. Kyrgyzstan believes that the success of reform depends on our ability to to strengthen cooperation among UN aid entities. We need to reduce duplication, improve coordination, and ensure that every mandate has clear objectives and measurable impact. The UN should move from fragmented and parallel efforts toward a more integrated and complementary approach, especially across the peace, development and humanitarian pillars. Financing remains a central challenge. Kyrgyzstan supports proposals to better align new mandates with realistic financial resources. Efficiency means not doing more with less, but doing better with what we have in a focused and measurable way. We must also make reporting a tool for management, not bureaucracy. Too many reports are rarely used. We need shorter, more digital and analytical reports that help decision making and strengthen accountability. Kyrgyzstan also wishes to highlight the situation of small and developing countries. Many of us with limited staff and small permanent missions face challenges in following numerous meetings and processes. Full engagement of all member states, regardless of size or capacity, is essential for a fair and representative United Nations. At the heart of these reforms must remain the human dimension. The real measure of UN success lies in its ability to prevent conflict, build peace and include people. In these efforts, we emphasize preventive diplomacy, regional cooperation and inclusive peace building that fully engage women and youth as agents of stability and resilience. Co Chairs we stand at a historic crossroads. The choice is ours to remain constrained by outdated procedures or to rise as a force for decisive and principled actions. Kyrgyzstan calls and all Member States to show political will, vision and courage so that the unity reform becomes a true turnpoint leading to an organization that acts swiftly, clearly and in service of all people. I thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank Kyrgyzstan for the statement. I give the floor now to Senegal to be followed by Norway.

**SEN**, Representative
Thank you. Dear Co Chair Dear Co Chairs, the delegation of Senegal aligns itself with the statements delivered by Iraq and Singapore respectively on behalf of the G77 and China and a small States group and would like to share the following points on its national capacity. My delegation thanks the Under Secretary General Ryder for his constant engagement to ensure ownership of this process by Member States and commend you Co Chairs for your efforts to create this opportunity of information and dialogue. You can continue to count on our full support. Firstly, my delegation encouraged efforts in terms of mandate monitoring tools, particularly the development of register of mandates, putting its and artificial intelligence to better contribution. This kind of registry should help us have that global perspective of existing mandates and of primary responsible entities with a view to identify obsolete or dormant mandates, overlaps or duplicates prior to the generation of new mandates. This mandate inventory should also serve to a better identification of implementing bodies, clarification of the rules and mission of entities involved in the implementation of cross cutting mandates, assessment of necessary budgetary and human resources, as well as advancing possibilities for financing through existing budgetary lines. In current programs about financing, the payment of assets contribution in due time remains critical for well implemented mandates. Nonetheless, this process can also nourish our reflections on how to defragment the resources available within the organization, including through the fungibility of voluntary contribution. Secondly, in line with the steps taken through the United Nations General assembly resolution 793 to 7 on revitalization of the work of the General assembly, formulation of mandates should be strengthened through concise, action oriented and time bound resolutions. This kind of approach shall form part of a revitalized coordination between the Secretariat mandated entities, Member State and other stakeholders with a view to discuss in a timely manner ways to create synergies between similar mandates and deciding on adjustments, mergers or elimination as appropriate. In this respect, the review of periodicity, length and format of reports should be considered in a way to give sufficient and efficient time to stakeholders to implement the mandates to take stock of the difficulties of implementation and to provide prospects for improvement and amendments. Finally, the issue of the implementation of mandates speaks to their cycle of life from creation to termination. One part of our challenge is also to give meaning to what that termination would be, whether through a plain and simple conclusion or through a form of continuation via another vehicle of action. By doing that, we will also help reconcile competing and overlapping lines of actions. I thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank the representative of Senegal for the statement. I now give the floor to Norway, to be followed by Angola.

**NOR**, Representative
Thank you coaches and thank you to the brief.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
Before we before Norway takes the floor, I'd just like to say thank you to USG Rider who has to leave for another engagement with the Secretary General. Thank you so much for being here with us and I'll give the floor back to Norway.

**NOR**, Representative
Thank you, thank you, thank you co chairs and thank you to the briefers for today. Norway particularly appreciates the clarity of the mandate delivery chapter on the SD report that informs our discussions today. Given that we're already into the afternoon session, I'll just focus on one particular aspect on reporting. We strongly support the Secretary General's proposals and prerogatives to prioritise and streamline requests and mandates for reports or meetings, recognizing the urgent need to modernise how the UN designs, manages and delivers data and information. As we heard this morning, the current culture of extensive reports to documentation and frequent meetings consume significant resources both for those producing them and for us, the Member States that receive them. With more than half of all active mandates requiring reports, most of them recurring and unevenly read, we should use this as an opportunity to step back and rethink how we as Member States are best served in terms of information sharing and accountability. Could we envision a future UN without formal reports instead of moving to digital systems, perhaps through an integrated UN digital platform? One offering a new kind of reporting with up to date multilingual access to visualized data which presents concise information and analysis rather than static written yearly updates? Could it perhaps also provide a snapshot of progress made on mandate implementation, including associated budgets from across the UN system? A new kind of digital visualization of information and analysis could be a valuable tool to enable evidence based decision making when we come to mandate renewals and hopefully improve coordination across UN entities. We welcome other concrete ideas that were presented by colleagues this morning, like the standard templates for drafting mandates as suggested by Singapore. Or does it explore further ideas like cooling off periods for mandates as suggested by Mexico? We also, in closing, wanted to echo the comments from the UK this morning on the importance of core funding, another key challenge outlined in the SG's report. Norway will expand on these ideas and others in our written inputs. Thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I thank Norway for your statement. I give the floor now to Angola who is the last speaker on our list.

**AGO**, Representative
Thank you Mr. Chair for giving this delegation the floor. Co Chairs Angola appreciates the organizer and all contributors engaged in advancing this critical discussion. Angola aligns with statement delivered by Iraq on behalf of G77/China and wish to emphasize the following. We recognize the effective execution of the United nations mandates requires a robust coordination across all agencies and domains. The intercontinental nature of the organization responsibilities demands a comprehensive approach. The UN80 initiative aims to make the UN nimbler and more effective while reducing inefficiencies and overlappings in its operations. Any reforms should ultimately serve the goal of better mandates implementation and service outcomes. Respecting the decision making authority of Member States guided by transparent government, government led oversight, Excellencies and Co Chairs to turn commitments into real progress, we advocate for clear, measurable objectives and continuous dialogue with Secretariats. Member States should steer the goal setting and assessment process with Secretariat providing supportive input rather than a directive role. While we see value in utilizing digital tools and artificial intelligence to identify inefficiencies, we stress the importance of applying these solutions judiciously and responsibly. Safeguards are crucial to protect privacy, ensure accuracy and prevent costly errors, particularly under current budgetary constraints. Angola also called for thorough and accessible information regarding which intergovernmental bodies are managing each mandate, along with regular updates on achievements and obstacles. Transparency is vital to identify board necklace and driving evidence based improvements. Finally, we insist that all entities adhere strictly to the mandates adopted by Member States, ensuring impartiality and compliance with agreed parameters. Angola remains committed to participating transparently, inclusively and constructively in the mandate review, ensuring that United nations can meet the expectations of all its Member States. I thank you.

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
Thank you so much Angola. We appreciate both your thoughtful intervention but also your patience in being the last speaker of today's session. We started the conversation this morning with a call from one of our colleagues to have an honest conversation and dialogue. And I think from where we're sitting up here at the front, it felt not only honest and constructive, but also substantive. It's thoughtful. You're being collaborative and you're really thinking about space specific ideas you can put on the table. So thank you so much to all of you. I will just mention a couple of things that we've heard and of course we're Feeding in your thoughts all the time into our thoughts as well. But what we heard from a lot of you today was about the importance of improving the quality and the impact of our work. That came through really strongly. A lot of you made a strong connection between the relationship between mandate creation and and mandate implementation. And there were calls by many of you to think about how we can do better when we create mandates, to make sure that implementation is more impactful. A lot of you have given really helpful suggestions about the practical tools and processes, templates, technology, knowledge management. This has all come through really clearly today that there seems to be a really large shared appetite to contemporise not only what we do, but the way we do our work. A lot of you spoke about how the way we fund the organisation, finance the organisation, has an impact on implementation and others spoke to the activities that we choose to mandate. The vast array of Secretary General reports and meetings and so forth are in fact a trade off at times to practical delivery on the ground, especially in a resource constrained environment. So these were some of the things that I heard today. We will go away, as we always do, and think deeply and review all your inputs that you have made to us and to each other today. But before adjourning, as we've previously announced, we just wanted to remind you that the next meeting of the Working Group will be a briefing on mandate review and that will take place on the 25th of November and then of course will be followed by the normal pattern of consultations on 3rd of December and with that that will complete, of course, this discovery phase of our work. We will give you, as we always do, more information on the mandate implementation implementation briefing in due course. We mentioned it earlier, but just to remind you again as well that we have that the President of the General assembly has scheduled an informal meeting of the General assembly on 11th of December for us to provide the General assembly, us as co chairs, to provide the General assembly with an update on the work and progress of the ad hoc, informal ad hoc working Group that will help us deliver against what we're required to do with the 15 December deadline, as was required in decision 79 571. Of course we remain here at your service. We're really happy if you come and contact us. You can do that directly and in person with us or with our teams. And of course you can do it in writing, including to the email address that we've provided to you earlier, including in the 12 November letter. So with that, again, just a warm thank you on behalf of my co chair and I, we think it was a really great session today. And the fact you stuck with us on a Friday afternoon shows your dedication. But with that, the meeting is adjourned.

## Session 7: Final Review and Next Steps (Nov 25, 2025)
Video: /video/k1q/k1q2ukeao9

**IAHWG**, Co-Chair
I call to order the informal meeting of the Working Group to hear a technical briefing on mandate implementation. We warmly welcome all of you to this technical briefing. We recognise the presence of Mr. Guy Ryder, under Secretary General for Policy and chair of the UN 80 taskforce. Mr. Locke Bahadur Thapa, Permanent Representative of Nepal to the United nations and President of the Economic and Social Council Ms. Inga Anderson, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program Ms. Ilse Branz Kheras, Assistant Secretary General for human rights and Ms. Claudia Bans, director of the Security Council Affairs Division. Before handing the floor to our briefers, please, please allow me to deliver some opening remarks on behalf of the co Chairs. We warmly thank Member States for your continued engagement in this important process. The briefings we convened on mandate creation and implementation provided new important data analysis, information and real world examples to Working Group members. Your questions to the briefers have so far unearthed further insights and your remarks at our two consultations have been thoughtful and have given us some good ideas that we have carefully noted. We hope that today's briefing on mandate review will be just as fruitful. Our briefers will discuss how UN mandates are reviewed across the UN system and how successful, coordinated and useful or not these are. They will of course also elaborate on the relationship between mandate creation, implementation and review from their perspectives. At our briefings and consultations, as well as in our meetings with Working Group members, we have consistently heard agreement among the membership that reform is urgently needed. We are at risk of losing the confidence of both our publics and political decision makers. And to build this back, we must restore the UN's ability to deliver across its its core mandates. We have heard about the clear through line between mandate creation and mandate implementation. But as you all know, and as many of you have mentioned in your statements, this should not be the end of the story. Without any review mechanisms, we will not be able to accurately assess how we are delivering against the objectives we set ourselves, nor the impact our decisions have on the lives of our constituents. The information and analysis that mandate reviews can uncover should play an important role in driving the work of this organisation. Being able to deliver on our undertakings and course correct where necessary, will naturally strengthen the UN's legitimacy. As we said last time, we have a responsibility to our citizens and to each other to implement the things we agree to here, the things our public expect of us to deliver for them and for others. Equally, review mechanisms should allow us to see clearly where we have been successful. When we have completed our work, we should be able to retire mandates. Indeed, ending Mandates in this way is maybe the highest measure of success. We have certain parts of the system have experience in reviewing, recalibrating and completing mandates that we hope to learn from today. It is for this reason that we encourage working group members to keep an open mind to the analysis they hear today and to be ambitious in the ideas they bring in the coming weeks. Without this, our ability to achieve change at the scale needed to improve mandate implementation may be compromised. I now pass the floor to Ambassador Wallace to outline the way ahead and to introduce our briefers.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Good morning. Today's briefing will be followed by consultations on 3 December, where working group members will again have the opportunity to offer their perspectives and ideas for consideration, as well as to ask further questions. We apologize for the short turnaround, but we trust in your understanding of the challenging timelines and constraints we face in this and other processes and remain confident that you are up to the task. As with our prior briefings, the briefers today have been selected for their experience with mandate implementation. They will present from different perspectives for us to all consider, and there will be an opportunity for questions from the floor once they have all presented. Like all of us here today, they are invested in the good functioning of the UN. With that, I give the floor to Mr. Guy Ryder, under Secretary General for Policy and Chair of the UNAT Task Force.

**UN Secretariat** | Guy Ryder, USG Policy
Thank you very much indeed. Ambassador Wallace, Ambassador Schwalger. Good morning, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. Well, thank you for this new opportunity to speak with you, to introduce the third stage of this mandate life cycle, the stage that we commonly refer to as the mandate review stage. And perhaps just to situate this discussion in the overall context of this process, we could look at this when it's up. Diagram of the mandate life cycle. I wonder if we can show it. Next one. There we are. This is just to remind us that we're in a mandate life cycle approach, which goes from the. The creation of mandates, how you adopt resolutions, the second stage of delivery, how the UN system implements mandates by turning them into activities to be undertaken across all pillars of the organization. That's the delivery phase. And then what we're coming on to now, crucially, the third phase, in which member states come back to look at whether the work that the UN system has undertaken is indeed achieving the results intended and whether mandates remain relevant or whether they need to be adjusted. And I think one way of looking at this review phase of the cycle is to see it as a sort of a steering operation where member states have the opportunity to set the forward trajectory of the organization and its activities. And if we're able to do that well, the entire mandate cycle can stay on course, moving us where we want to get to towards greater positive impact. And alternatively, when it's not done so well, I think we can all see that there is a danger that the system can enter into a sort of drift, and we want to avoid that. Now, as we see it, for a mandate review process to work optimally, two conditions reflected in the graphic before you would need to be met. Firstly, Member States would need to have available to them a review process that allows them to steer strategically, not simply automatically to repeat discussions year after year as a sort of a. A default position. But that's only one half of the story. The other half is that the UN system, our responsibility is to provide information that you need to assess the work that we have undertaken. You need to have access to clear plans, clear results, and a presentation of the links between resource utilization and outcomes obtained. So we believe these two components would be integral to a successful review phase. Now, perhaps I can go through each of these components in turn, beginning with the Member State review process. Now, the question we might ask is what are the means at the disposal of Member States to provide the type of steer that the organization requires? Obviously, the resolutions that you adopt are the most important and obvious instrument at your disposal. But there is more than that because you shape the organization's direction also by deciding what goes on the agenda, how often issues come back for discussion, the kinds of reports that you want and how frequently you want them. And then all of this comes on top of the resolutions that you ultimately adopt. All of this indicates that you Member States are in the pilot seat throughout this entire process. You set the course and the UN system must follow your direction and do it to its best abilities. Now, in the mandates report, we identified initially the issue of frequently recurring business with limited changes to mandates. That's in quotes. Frequently recurring business with limited changes to mandates. And some of the statistics that we presented in the report, I think are quite suggestive. In 2024, the General assembly discussed about 370 agenda items and sub items. And of these, about 60%. Two hundred and fifteen are discussed every year. Thirty percent of the issues discussed have been considered since 1990, and 55% of recurring resolutions have been very similar to the ones adopted in previous years, meaning at least 80% of the text is identical, the same word for word. And these numbers, as I've said, are suggestive that in certain aspects, the steering process that I'VE talked to might simply be operating by autopilot now. Currently, as I've indicated, many agenda items come back year after year and there may be reason for that. I don't think it is self evident that this is inappropriate, particularly for entity specific or operational mandates. It may be that this makes perfect sense, but perhaps for larger system wide transformative agenda, the ones where change takes time, reviewing them less frequently but perhaps with more time and attention could be more useful. It could give space for meaningful progress over time and means that when negotiations do happen there is a real addition of value. As has been stressed by many of you in previous meetings in this working group, and I recall Ambassador Wray's parting intervention last time, these processes are not set in stone, they are amenable to change. The periodicity of considering agenda items, requesting reports and adopting resolutions can, if you so decide, all be adapted so that issues stay on the radar but recur at the most appropriate and productive intervals possible. In the report we also underlined that Member States could decide to undertake collective assessments of mandates, addressing related issues rather than addressing mandates one by one. Now these kinds of collective reviews, if I could call them those, they do happen, but they are the exception rather than the rule. One example of a collective review is the revitalization of the General assembly, which you are all familiar with. Another is the quadriennnual Comprehensive Policy Review, the QCPR process, which takes a strategic system wide view of the entirety of the UN development system. And as you are aware, the QCPR runs on a four year cycle, setting expectations for the entire UN development system, not just entity by entity or individual issue by issue. And this longer cycle creates a degree of space for real delivery, for learning, and for adjusting course in ways which are meaningful and consequential. There are other examples, but perhaps a QCPR approach is one which is instructive for other pillars as well. A further issue that we highlighted in the report is that most mandates do not include review mechanisms in them, and as you can see from this straightforward slide, around 86% of mandates lack any review mechanisms and this means that renewal can become the default setting even when circumstances may have changed. Of the 14% of UN mandates which do include review clauses, it's interesting to note that most are resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the Human Rights Council. They tend to relate to peace operations, fact finding missions or commissions of inquiry or sanctions measures. And I think you will hear more about these from my colleagues with us today in their presentations in the Development Pillar. One example where we have a Built in process and timeline is Resolution 71 of 2015, the one that adopted the Sustainable Development Goals. That resolution sets the SDG horizon for 2030, after which member States will review the progress made and determine next steps, as was indeed already the case after the deadline set for the Millennium Development Goals. So when it matters, clearly these things can be done. A more recent example, one which might be fresh in the memory of many of us, is General assembly resolution 79325 on the establishment and functioning of the independent Artificial Intelligence Panel. That resolution includes a review mechanism and timeline, and I quote, the continuation of the terms of reference of the Panel and the dialogue may be considered by the General assembly during the review of the Global Digital compact at its 82nd session. These are examples of resolutions which do have built in review mechanisms and we might learn from them. In these cases, the predictability of the review process and timeline may be helpful in ensuring that structured discussions among Member States are prioritized, and this in itself can lead to better outcomes. Now, having said all of that in respect of Member States, let me recall the role of the the system itself, the UN system, in this process, the second component that I mentioned at the outset, and recall the four potential solutions in this regard that were included in the Secretary General's report. And I would recall that these are the manner in which Member States could seek to systematize review practices across mandating bodies, make review clauses the norm, review and steer impact more collectively, meaning at the level of systems development, humanitarian peace and security, or the human rights pillar and streamline agenda to spend less time repeating discussions and more time steering strategically. Sorry, that part still belongs to the Member States component. I'm now moving on to the UN System component Excellency's colleagues. As it regards the UN System side, our role is to provide inputs to enable your review to operate optimally. As I've said, for reviews to work well, the system must provide a clear picture on how mandates translate into results. And here there are four things we need to pay attention to. We need a roadmap, a strategic plan on what goals any entity is pursuing long term. We need a results chain, a framework linking resources to activities, outputs and outcomes. A budget that shows value organized around results, not just cost categories in a more administrative manner. And we need strong communication reports that show our stakeholders how our work is making a difference. Today, as our report reflects, the challenge is that these plans, these results change. These budgets often look different in different parts of the UN system. Some entities have strategic plans, others do not. Some have Integrated results and resource frameworks, but many don't. And how we measure results differs across UN entities. Reporting and planning tools are inconsistent. The consequence of all of this is that it makes it hard for you, our Member States, to judge system wide performance or compare the impact of the work of different entities and from this to draw appropriate conclusions. So that is why we point to one simple but critical potential solution to these challenges in the Secretary General's report. And that is to strengthen and harmonize management for results mechanisms across the UN system, including how results are measured and how they are communicated. Breaking that down in concrete terms, that means that every major entity should have, firstly, a multi year strategic plan, secondly, an integrated results and resource framework based on a system wide standard, and thirdly, a budget that is organized around results, not just categories like staff and operations, administrative cost categories. And when results chains are completed are complete. Excuse me. And when budgets show how they contribute to outcomes, this enables a lot of things to happen. It enables you to have a system wide view of impact and how it is obtained, to see how different entities contribute to shared outcomes, this thorny issue of overlap and duplication, to see whether resources are aligned with results and to see where adjustments might be needed. Co Chairs, Dear participants, let me draw to a conclusion by clarifying that this type of mandate review is not simply about adding another layer of bureaucracy or process. It can be a tool for you to ensure that the UN system is and remains focused, coherent, effective and accountable. With better designed review cycles and stronger performance information, we can make our mandate delivery more strategic and above all, more impactful. Ultimately then, this is not about process, it's about people. It's about the 8 billion people the UN system connects to shared goals. It's about the 400 million people whose lives the UN helps improve on the ground, most of them in least developed countries. So I hope that we can work together through this working group to deliver better for the people who depend on us. And I thank you once again for this opportunity and look forward to your comments and questions.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you, Jess. Thank you, Guy. Thank you. I now give the floor to Mr. Lok Bahadur Tafa, Permanent Representative of Nepal to the United nations and President of the Economic and Social Council.

**NPL** | Lok Bahadur Thapa, PR; ECOSOC President
Thank you, distinguished Co Chairs, Excellencies, distinguished delegations. Thank you Co Chairs for inviting me today to join you. It is always a pleasure to talk about the ECOSOCS mandate, which is firmly rooted in the Charter entrusting the Council with responsibilities to promote international cooperations on economic, social, cultural, educational, health and related issues. ECOSOC serves as a platform for dialogue and policymaking, coordinating the UN development systems and engaging diverse stakeholders. ECOSOCS approaches the reviews stakeholders stage of the mandate life cycle through a range of legislative and oversight functions derived from the UN Charter GA resolutions and outcomes of the UN conferences and summits. Since the adoptions of the 2030 Agenda, ECOSOC has focused on coherence across the UN systems to support member states in meeting the global commitments. The High Level Political Forum, convened annually under its auspices, is the central platform to review SDG progress, share lessons and adopt our ministerial declarations. Beyond the hlpf, ECOSOC holds annual forums on financing for development, partnerships, youth and science and technology and innovations, adopting resolutions and recommendations across its program of work. It also responds to urgent global issues through special meetings that inform its broader sessions. Excellencies Viewing its own annual work program, the Council is also interested to oversee the work of five regional Commissions, eight functional Commissions, nine Export Committees, two Standing Committees, and a range of other bodies that report to it. These subsidiary bodies address a wide range of sustainable development issues, from statistics and crime prevention to science and technology, forest population, gender equality, indigenous peoples issues, as well as the needs of the LECs. They regularly report on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The Council periodically reviews their work on the basis of the recommendations contained in the reports of the subsidiary bodies as well as provides guidance based on current trends and needs on their future work. For instance, during its 2025 sessions, Ecosoc adopted 35 resolutions, signed 45 decisions, not including those related to elections. The Council discharges its charter mandated coordination functions by reviewing the work undertaken by the UN systems on the sustainable development issues across the economic, social, health and related fields, with a view to promoting coordinated actions and advancing long term solutions. Excellencies in recent years there have been efforts to streamline mandates. The ECOSOC Vice President, Costa rica at the 2025 session issued a Call to Action for the Humanitarian affairs segment in state of negotiating a resolution. Streamlining mandates also includes avoiding the introduction of new mandates unless accompanied by commensurate resources or by the clear adjustment or conclusion of existing overlapping obligations. There are also lessons learned from the recent experiences, particularly regarding the process of adoption of the Ministerial Declaration at both HLPF and Ecosoc. The 2024 Ministerial Declaration illustrated challenges due to procedural arrangements and the potential conflicts caused by the different voting rights at the ECOSOC and the hlpf. Member States may wish to address these situations during the forthcoming GA review of ECOSOC and the HLPF Excellencies The General assembly periodically reviews ECOSOC work and the provisions governing the HLPF in its resolutions 78285 the General assembly agreed to fully review at its 80th sessions the arrangement of the ecosocial and the HLPF. These reviews will be conducted jointly. Building on the lesson learned to ensure alignment with the broader 2030 Agenda follow up processes following GA Resolution 75 290A ECOSOC launched an internal review of its subsidiary bodies in 2022 facilitated by the Council Vice President. The process included assessment and recommendations by the Bureau of ecosoc Functional Commissions and expert bodies and informal consultations among Member States. This process resulted in ECOSOC Decisions 2022334 inviting implementations of the recommendations contained in the Vice President's summary. Furthermore, a number of ECOSUC functional commissions also conduct periodic reviews of their own working methods. The next review of ECOSAC subsidiary bodies initially mandated for 2026 is proposed to be postponed to 2027 to allow the process to be informed by the outcomes of the GA review process. In line with the fact of the future, ECOSHOCK launched an intergovernmental process in 2025 to explore option to revitalize the CSW Co facilitated by Ireland and St. Kitts and Navies. The process concluded with the adoption of ECOSOC resolutions on revitalizations of the CSW reaffirming CSW's role in follow up to the Fourth World Conference on Women and its outcome. The efforts have also been made to foster more effective complementarity between the General assembly and ecosac with the QCPR as an example of the two bodies identifying complementary rules namely of policymaking one for the GA every four years and the annual oversight of implementation and guidance by Member States to the UN Development Systems and Funding Compact ousted under ECOSOC in its Operational Activities for Development segment. Regular dialogue between the President of the GA and ECOSOC help ensure coherence including monthly meetings and annual joint meetings to identify shared and important issues of relevance to Member States Excellencies regarding the voluntary national reviews. The 2030 Agenda encourages member States to undertake regular and inclusive reviews of progress at national and sub national levels. These reviews are intended to be voluntary and country driven by presented at the HLPF under the auspices of ECOSA. Since 2015, 402 PNRs have been presented by 190 countries and the European Union with 148 countries submitting two or more reviews. The Resolution 75-190B suggested improvements the BNRs encouraging countries to highlight challenges, gaps and next steps to accelerate the implementation of the SDG and to conduct a BNR once the four year cycle of the hlpf. Nonetheless, certain challenges in the BNR process continue to be observed and addressing them could further strengthen the mechanisms, effectiveness and impact Excellencies. Integrated nature of the 2030 agenda requires close cooperations across intergovernmental bodies. The upcoming ECOSOC and HLPF review by the GA is an opportunity to reflect on the Council work and enhance the complementarity between ECOSOC and HLPF to ensure that their work is mutually reinforcing and accelerate the 2030 Agenda implementation. Taken together, the UN 80 initiative, the General assembly review of EcoShock and HLPF at its 80th session and the EcoShock review of its subsidiary machinery create opportunities for Member States to strengthen the functions, coherence and the impact of the ECOSAC and HLPF in advancing the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs. I thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the president of Ecosop. I now give the floor to Ms. Inga Anderson, executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program.

**UNEP** | Inger Andersen, Executive Director
Thank you very much and good evening from Nairobi, the only global headquarters of the United nations in the Global South. It's a pleasure and honor to speak here today this evening and we think that this mandate review is very critical and we've engaged very much throughout the process. UNEP, the United Nations Environment Program, was founded in 1972 in the Stockholm Conference and it really is the place whereby mandate we're supposed to promote international cooperation on the environment, keep the environment under review, which essentially is science, and serve as a focal point for environmental action within the UN system. And so being that pillar of the environment, we are enriched when other agencies take on the environmental issue but but address it through their mandate lens, be it human rights, be it children, be it health, et cetera. So what some would call decentralization of the environmental mandate to the country, we call it a great strengthening and we need to think about this like you do in the context of your ministries of environment, where of course, whether it's roads or transport or urban or health environment features just as much so for UNEP itself. Over the years since 1972 we have seen Member States through the UNEP processes give birth to a large number of conventions and two of these, you will know well, are not managed by UNEP or not hosted by UNEP. That will be climate change and desertification. But 17 others are indeed hosted by UNEP. And of course, therefore but of course answerable to the party driven governance process of the COP structure, which you will know very well in 2022 and again in 2024 at the United Nations Environment assembly, discussions were held. How can we ensure that the Environmental assembly, the United Nations Environmental assembly, creates a greater degree of synergy without interfering in the sovereign nature, if I can say so, of the multilateral environmental agreements and their cops? And so at this point now in the unea, the United Nations Environment assembly, each assembly has an MEA day, an MEA Week, mea, Multilateral Environment Agreement. Executive Directors and Presidents come and participate in high level discussions and panels, et cetera. There's a tent, because we are a tent city here. When we have unea, which the whole week will focus on MEA dialogue precisely to enable a greater synergistic conversation, so to say, then how do we work and how do we maximize the impact of the mandates that are given to us by Member States through the United Nations Environment Assembly? Well, Member States are about to, in December, at the upcoming UNEA Environment assembly, approve the next four year medium term strategy and the two year program of work. This will be decided of course at the conference, but at the Assembly. But essentially it will deal with the three elements that UNEPT works on. If I can summarize very much, climate stability, nature, biodiversity and land and pollution. And what we then do is we construct a one impact framework that ensures that the whole of UNEP approach, where the different programs and projects that are funded by a variety of sources which are delivering obviously the mandate are then reported on and leads to an organizationally agreed by Member States vision under the medium term strategy. So the impact framework also rides on a very, very strong measurement framework which shows how the work that we are doing here at UNEP is aligned with the International Agreed Goals, I.e. the goals in the Climate Convention, in the Chemical Conventions, in the Biodiversity Convention, et cetera. And so that allows for that. Even though these multilateral environmental agreements and their COPS take their decisions outside of the UNEA structure, nevertheless, a program that we see Member States approve is underpinning the very commitments that Member States have made in the COP structure. So therefore, we have an integrated theory of change that link the mandates to measurable outcomes and that ensures that we translate those mandates that have derived from UNEA or indeed from the cops into quantifiable impact and not just sort of activities. And the targets for these are set on the basis of implementation capacity and budgets, obviously. And so when it comes to resource mobilization, because we only receive around 3% of our monies from the regular budget and the rest we mobilize. And so we seek to do this based on an allocation of all resources. We have a strategic planning process that is linked with program budgeting. Our total program in a two year period is just under 3 billion. The vast amount of this obviously being programmatic. And we mobilize as if regular budget, but voluntary indicative scale of contribution just usually is around 19 million or so per year. That helps to pay for the spine of the organization. So when we seek to then report to Member States, we seek to show progress against agreed indicators which are publicly available. I should say to ensure that UNEP can be transparent and very much seen that here's what the science says, here's what Member States decided, here's what UNEP is doing. That model demonstrates very much how the results based evidence informs, performs the mandate review and connects the mandates to the results, to the learning, etc. We do regular program performance reports to Member States. We do that on a quarterly basis. And so there's also a learning dimension obviously in that. So through all of this with a mandate, we take very much, if I can say so, a life cycle approach to the mandate that is given to us, that are given to us by Member States, the strategic guidance, the development, support and implementation. Now, since we are supposed to keep the environment under the review and therefore do the science, if I can say so, and you will recall that IPCC was created by a UNEP Governing Council resolution, you will recall that ipbs, a Biodiversity and Land Science Policy Panel, was created by a UNEP Governing Council resolution. And just recently the Intergovernmental Science Policy Panel on Chemicals, Waste and Pollution Created by UNEA resolution. That science plus what UNEP Secretariat does itself allows us to do some degree of horizon watching to therefore the Executive Director about nine months or so before the United Nations Environment assembly issue a report to Member States saying these are the areas that are sort of horizon issues where you may wish to. Well, recognizing that resolutions are a totally sovereign issue pertaining to Member States and prerogative. Nevertheless, as we are supposed to review the science, we say here are areas that are coming up that are urgent or important or under attended to. Member States may then decide or not to take inspiration from the Executive Director's report to submit resolutions in that space. Once resolutions begin to be submitted, we submit a what we call a technical note on each resolution. This is a technical note that deals with five issues. How is that particular resolution aligned with the existing mandate and a strategy that you are about to approve at the same assembly, what is the relationship to existing mandates either within UNEP or in other fora that is is it duplicative? In which case we would suggest it's duplicative and therefore you may wish to rethink Third, a legal assessment on the substance and procedural matters. Fourth, the impact of the proposed draft. How would we measure whether we have done the thing that is being proposed? And fifth, how much is it going to cost? And so this we make available this Technical Note to Member States well ahead of the United Nations Environment assembly to allow Member States to use this as they would see fit for their consideration and deliberations. We also allow us assign a technical, technically, scientifically and technical qualified focal point to be available to Member States in each of the resolution discussion meetings and of course we provide oral briefing briefings to Member States on the technical notes to ensure that some of the finer technical and scientific issues are highlighted. Now, once a resolution has been adopted, we then support Member States through the implementation tracking portal and reporting portal. We have established a resolutions portal that is publicly accessible and that monitors and reports on how we're doing on resolution A, B or C. It tracks and outlines the implementation plans for each resolution. It provides milestones, the results, the availability of resources, the learning, the opportunity and the challenges, the risks and the lessons learned, the partners and so on and so forth. And because we see of course Member States circulate in and out in terms of our permanent representatives, so we do familiarization sessions with permanent missions with this tracker so that they themselves, when new PRs come in, can follow this through. And when we have completed a task, and an obvious one would be that we were asked two years ago to help establish the Science Policy Panel on Chemicals, Waste and Pollution and in July of this year this got gaveled and so we therefore have this panel. So now that resolution can be retired, but when a resolution has been completed, then the monitoring and reporting portal for resolutions will provide a detailed report on the completion of that particular resolution. Now you asked me my final point to reflect on the SG's report on the proposed solutions to improve the mandate review and we support all of the above and then some we think that there's a lot that could be done to follow quicker through, to monitor better, maybe particularly in two areas, to systematize and to reinforce the efforts that are underway to strengthen the mandate review mechanisms and to ensure that these efforts are in place across the various mandating bodies and also to include inspiring clauses as we just heard from USG Guy Ryder in the resolutions having more explicit mention of what is the results, when is it achieved and what is the lifespan, so that these resolutions are not carried into the forever, or at least we could have objective conditionalities under which something is continued or not, so sort of on, off switch. Additionally, for the environmental pillar, of course, Member States may want to consider how they could delineate better what belongs in the assembly that the General assembly has established, the United Nations Environment assembly, which has the technical skills, the Scientific Secretariat and the environmental mandate related to the United nations and what they may choose to put at unga. So for us, we very, very much look forward to continuing working on and support the outcome of this working group and to contribute to enhancing the mandate life cycle at this very crucial time for the environment. Thank you very much. Cheers.

I thank Ms. Anderson. I now give the floor to Ms. Ilse Brands Karis, Assistant Secretary General for Human Rights.

**[Speaker Unknown]**
Thank you, Ambassador Wallace. Dear co Chairs, Excellencies, distinguished delegates, it's my honor to represent the High Commissioner and our Office for Human Rights here today. I wanted to start with just three small contextual points to bring the perspective of human rights into the discussion.

**OHCHR** | Ilse Brands Karris, ASG Human Rights
So obviously this is the focus here, following on previous discussions you've had is the mandate review. But clearly it relates to impact and prioritization as well as cost effectiveness. So obviously it links very well into the creation and implementation and efficiency effectiveness strand, as well as the structural programs, of course, also have very, very clear links where human rights is part of it. A second point is that the Human rights pillar which we here are talking about, it is of course the office of the High Commissioner as the UN entity, as the secretariat, but the ecosystem, importantly is the Human Rights Council with its universal periodic review, the investigative mechanisms, the special procedures, the mechanisms belonging there, but also the treaty bodies. So we do have we're talking about both Human Rights Council mandates and GA mandates, including the one that actually established the High Commissioner's mandate itself, the broad one, and to more limited extent, ECOSOC as well, ohchr, you may have noticed, has the largest amount number of mandates cited, 877. But it should be taken into account that they're very varied. Some are large, some small, long, continuous, versus those that are specific. So it takes a differentiated approach to deal with those. We also have the specificity, as you will know, but still a reminder that the Human Rights Council as well as the Office of the High Commissioner's Headquarters are in Geneva. So we importantly often need to discuss the link between Geneva and New York, the reinforcement of that link that is needed for consistency and effective use of human rights as mandated by Member states. And obviously it also this mandate review relates to the Human Rights Council streamlining efforts that the Human Rights Council president has been leading on and of course the Human Rights Council third committee links and the working methods as well as review of status of the Human Rights Council. So all of that for context generally, we certainly also have the same categories of concerns that USG Rider already pointed to for review. And therefore those recommendations from the SG's report are the ones we definitely need to focus on. Namely the shortcomings in mandate review process and also limited changes even when reviews do take place. And also the other side, the gaps regarding the system input relating to impact cost effectiveness. Obviously that is needed as evidence for the reviews linking also to the resources and budget structure issues and the insufficient attention on the adequacy sustainability of resources for mandates that we obviously need to make sure that the results are more visible. Both of the Human Rights Council with all of the elements I pointed to as well as the Office of the High Commissioner, there have been many successes on the human rights. Since we're focusing now maybe on challenges. So just to point that out, obviously both on the norm setting side of it as well as the actual practice of human rights. But I will here just note because of limits in time the challenges that we are indeed focusing on we have the proliferation of mandates. We had 39% more mandates in 10 years. That is a duplication, resource gaps, politicization of reviews as well, which is a concern on human rights specifically the duplication and fragmentation. There's multiple mechanisms that cover similar issues, reducing efficiency, visibility, the mandates and USG Rider pointed to this of the Human Rights Council typically do include clauses for review, but that generally range from one to three years. But renewals nevertheless are often automatic, especially for thematic mandates. And geographic mandates also are very rarely discontinued. So we have a review process that lacks rigor and the process influenced at times more by political dynamics rather than a clear and solid impact assessment as is needed clearly. Also I mentioned the resource gaps, the renewals, if they do in the review, they are doing without the matching resources, not looking at that aspect of it. So that creates in itself the cycle of implementation deficits. And obviously that will then impact the impact that assessment that will go into the for that is needed for a solid review. We also have the reporting overload mechanisms, Human Rights Council mechanisms. Several of them report both to the Human Rights Council and the General assembly that can duplicate content. It obviously also increases costs. So the proposals we have potentially for Member State consideration, especially for the review part here, but we also have other proposals for other discussions. The High Commissioner had recently a week ago, dialogues with Member States in Geneva. He looks forward to exchanging also with Member States in New York. But there's work that was done under the Human Rights Cluster guided and directed by the SG's proposals and that based on reflections both from the experience and also consultations with Member States as well as other stakeholders experts. So there is a short non paper for discussion on the Human Rights Council specifically that the High Commissioner has shared with with Member States in Geneva and of course we will be looking forward to also discussions on that when that is opportune. The other part of those proposals include institutionalizing regular evidence based reviews, especially for mandates exceeding a certain duration, reflecting on the criteria for those reviews of course, including prioritization, differentiation of those continuing long term mandates versus the short term ones and others introducing standardized clauses for review with opportunity for decision on continuation or termination of a mandate consider linking any new mandates to the conclusion of existing ones in the review, consolidate overlapping mandates and consider short term or single report mandates for emerging issues strengthening the cross pillar coordination to ensure mandates reflect integrated priorities across peace, development and human rights and ensure transparent and solidly calculated linkage to resources. That is again the Geneva coming to New York decisions and the Fifth Committee in particular the linking up on the review and content of IT and of course efficiencies measures reducing duplication and reporting to the Human Rights Council and General assembly considering for instance biannual reporting, virtual presentations and consolidate overlapping mandates in various functions, in particular Protection investigators. There are some initiatives underway and we do have a preliminary version for now already of a mandate mapping tool that OHCHR has developed and is continuing to develop further. It is to support Member States decision making. It's a comprehensive overview of mandates mechanisms and reports mandated since 2019. It focuses especially on identifying overlaps and duplication across Human Rights Council mechanisms, treaty bodies and special procedures. It is meant to inform rationalization and it is obviously relevant for the 2026 review General assembly review as well and I would like to note that it fits very well with the SG's proposed digital mandate registry and AI tools for use. That tool is already available for Member States to use, but there is a caveat of course it needs further work and development. We have been doing it within the resources we had. It needs more investment in it and also in order to link it to the financial side and obviously increased use of AI as well and digital Technology in a more advanced phase as part of the General Assembly. Another initiative under the way, the resolution 79 192. The chair of the third committee and the President of the Human Rights Council are working, as many of you know, on a roadmap for the progressive reduction of the number of mandates reporting to each session of the Third Committee. And in all of this we also have some emerging good practices that we can point to. Indeed, on this mapping tool, it has been very well received by Member States because obviously it will help to review and also thus streamline the workload. The application of criteria when reviewing and before renewing mandates is being also further developed, including examining existing results, merging also related mechanisms, integration of existing experts into new inquiries instead of creating entirely new mechanisms is one also initiative underway. And also we had from the Human Rights Council last session, the consolidation of special procedures mandates in the first, where there was a first merger of two mandates as pointing the way ahead, potentially of course needing also assessment. So overall I would like to really thank for the opportunity of being here and the great work of this working group on mandates as an opportunity to really push ahead with all of these necessary initiatives, bringing in the perspective of of New York and Geneva in particular, of course, where the human rights bridging is so necessary. Certainly the Office of the High Commissioner looks forward to engagement with Member States on these and on other issues.

**[Speaker Unknown]**
And of course the High Commissioner will hope to also be directly engaging on any follow up and really looking at the UN 80 as the great opportunities and also understanding that time is of the essence. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank Ms. Brands Karris and I'll give the floor to Ms. Claudia Bans, Director, Security Council Affairs Division.

**UN Secretariat** | Claudia Bans, Director, Security Council Affairs Division
Distinguished Co Chairs, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this opportunity to share some insights on how the Security Council conducts mandate review. I must admit I first hesitated when the co Chairs invited me to be part of this panel. As the Executive Director of UNEP has already pointed out, the drafting of mandate is a sovereign issue and the prerogative of its members. The Secretariat is usually not there when Council members negotiate mandates. However, we are there when they discuss and take decisions on mandates. And I'm therefore happy to elaborate a bit about one recent trends in the review and termination of mandates by the Security Council and two the procedures, working methods and tools the Council uses to make these decisions and 3 how the Secretariat, and particularly the Security Council Affairs Divisions or my division, supports the Council in this process. While the Council has applied an array of approaches to mandate creation, review and termination over its 80 years of decision making. In my remarks I will focus on the Council's contemporary practice. We can categorize the Council's review of mandates into three broad approaches. First, for most of its practice after the Cold War, the Council has taken a gradual approach to transitions, drawdowns and determination of mandates, guided by recommendations and findings of Secretariat reviews and assessments, and conducted with varying degrees of coordination and consultations with host states and other relevant stakeholders. The most prominent examples falling under this category are the reconfiguration, drawdown and eventual termination of peace operations in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Coteva, Timor Leste, Nepal and Guinea Bissau among a number of other countries, probably the success stories when there was a. Staged approach to their drawdown. Second, the Council has at occasion used time bound mandates with explicitly set deadlines for reviews, drawdowns and eventual mandate termination, some of which include so called sunset clauses. This is the case of Somalia and the deployment of the United Special Political Mission, ANTMIS and the African Union led AWSOM Peace Enforcement Mission. The mandates of these missions include early defined phases of deployment from the very outset, including expected termination dates in the two cases for Antmis it's 2026 and for OSOM it's 2029. Another example was the creation of the United nations mandate in Colombia in 2016. It started out with a narrow mandate to support the implementation of the ceasefire and cessation of hostage hostilities, which was later scaled up and transitioned into a mission with a broader mandate to support the implementation of the peace agreement. The third trend in Council mandate review has been less gradual in approach where major changes or terminations of mandates were made further to requests from host governments or based on case specific considerations of Council members themselves. In 2023, the Council decided to terminate the mandates of MINUSMA, the Peace Operation in Mali or peacekeeping operation in Mali and unitams in the political mission in Sudan. Further to request from the host governments Mali and Sudan and in the context of challenging security conditions on the ground. In 2024, the council did not renew the Mali sanctions regime and thereby effectively terminated the relevant Committee and its Panel of experts. Similarly, while extending the sanctions regime and the 1718 committee, that's the sanctions committee on DPRK. In the same year the Council terminated the mandate of Panel of Experts concerning the Democratic People's Republic of the Korea. Most recently this year in August, the Council decided to terminate after 40 years of deployment the mandate of UNIFIL as of 31st December 2026. The Council also indicated possible reconfigurations of UNMAHA, that's the UN Mission in Hudaydah in Yemen and Minerso in Western Sahara in the coming year. Further to upcoming reviews to be conducted by the Secretariat. Of specific note are also the sanctions regime, in addition to the ones I have already mentioned, which have been adapted regularly, taking into account improvements in the situation on the ground. The Secretariat has contributed to these reviews by conducting assessment visits with benchmarks identified benchmarks and this assessment coincided with Council decisions to adjust the measures, particularly in lifting the arms embargo vis a vis the governments in Central African Republic and Somalia. Now, turning to the Council's working methods, I would like to highlight three practices that are closely tied to how the Council review mandates. The first is the preparation of the Council's monthly Provisional Program of Work, which is the basic planning tool the Council uses to organize its work. While the program I think it's the previous one. While the program is agreed upon by Council members on the first working day of the month, this is being prepared with the relevant presidencies at least four months ahead of the actual Presidency. And this program of work is basically based on it lists all the mandated meetings and mandate renewals and expirations on to which Council members usually add then their elective meetings and signature events. But the framework of the monthly program is actually based on the mandate and report reporting cycle of the Security Council. Although there was a significant increase in so called unscheduled or emergency meetings in the past three years, the mandated activities stemming from previous decisions and existing practice continue to form the overall framework for the monthly schedule in the Security Council as part of its support to Council presidencies and members in preparation of this meeting. Monthly Program SCAD Our Division maintains and circulates to Member two important planning documents on a monthly basis. One is the monthly Forecast. It's a document that outlines all the upcoming mandate renewals, reports and expirations and the Security Council Reporting and Mandate Cycle that provide the overview on the upcoming reporting and mandate expiration in accordance with previous decisions and existing practice. One of the two documents is 100 pages long, but it's structured that you can go month by month, which is useful and for us an indispensable tool to organize the program of work. Both of these documents are publicly available on the website. Second, the Council also has, although not a direct correlation to the number of active meeting mandates, but the Council's annual review of the items on its agenda, which is also known as the Summary Statement, is another important way of how Members strive to streamline the work of the Security Council. So every first week of January each year, the Secretariat publishes a comprehensive version of the Summary Statement in which the items are divided in two categories. One category is those items on the agenda of the Security Council which have been considered by the Security Council in the preceding three years, and the second one is a category that the items have not been considered by the Security Council. This is then reviewed to subject by all by Member States. And those agenda items which have not been considered are actually due to deletion. They will be deleted from the agenda of the Council unless a Member State sends a letter and requests that the agenda item is maintained on the agenda of the Security Council. This process of review was introduced in 1996. Around 1996. In 1993, there were 207 items on the agenda of the Security Council, and now it's 65. So in the past 10 years it was around 60 agenda items on the Council's agenda. The third important aspect of mandate review is the role of penholders in Council decision making and mandate review. Penholdership is codified in the Presidential Note, and it remains an informal arrangement whereby one or more Council members initiate and chair the informal drafting process. The aim of the penholdership, as described in note 507, was to foster timely initiatives to ensure Council action while preserving the continuity of and with a view to enhancing efficiency in the work of the Council. These penholders, they have a role as conveners of the drafting process and they have significant influence in setting out the methodology and content of mandate reviews in the Council. Council members have also encouraged penholders to prioritize the fortune of consensus census, ensure early exchange of information, informal consultations with the broader United nations membership, particularly concerned states to regularly consult the Secretariat and troop and police contributing countries. Most of the penholders are in the hands of the Permanent members or the P3, but all council members can actually work as penholders or carry out the function of penholders. The process remains an informal one, although this has been codified in note 507. And a final point I wanted to mention is about mandate duration in Security Council mandates. While most mandates, I think the large majority, particularly those pertaining to peace operations and sanctions regimes, are set for a period of one year. Others are renewed and reviewed. At longer for example UNOCCA, UNAWAS, these are regional offices and the 1267 monitoring team. They will be renewed every three years and CTET every four years. You also have a number of mandates that have a shorter intervals undof the peacekeeping operation every six months and a number of Other mandates remain, including several peacekeeping operations open ended, as well as some of the sanctions measures. Open ended peace operations are anmo, gib, anso, anmic, UNRCCA and Anschol sanctions measures, Al Shabaab, Al Qaeda and Yemen and as well as the committees of Guinea Bissau and Iraq, they remain open ended. I leave it at that. Co Chairs, thank you again for inviting us.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank Ms. Bands Excellencies, colleagues. I know that time is now limited for questions. We have just about 13 minutes to go, so we ask that the questions are succinct to allow for everyone who wants to pose their questions to do so. We thought it was important for you to hear practical examples of review mechanisms that are already in place across the UN system and good practices that we can contemplate as we go through our process. I will now give the floor to the distinguished PR of Norway.

**NOR**, PR
Thank you very much. You've certainly given us a lot to think about, also how this reflects and plays into mandate creation. But I was struck about something you said, Ilse, about the Human Rights Council. If I didn't misunderstand you, and I hope I didn't, I heard that many of the human rights mandates have clauses for review, but that they almost automatically leads to renewal. And that makes me wondering what the sort of mechanics of the review is, what kind of discussions take place, what kind of reporting or what kind of background does the Council have then to sort of almost automatically renew the mandates?

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you. I thank Norway. I give the floor now to the distinguished PR of Singapore.

**SGP**, PR
Thank you very much. Co Chairs, very useful briefing indeed for all of us. I have actually many questions in my. Mind. But let me start perhaps with a question relating to cost. When we establish a mandate, there's clearly a cost dimension in terms of a PBI being required. But when we renew a mandate. Or. Put it in a default mode where it goes through every year, is there a way of quantifying the cost of not doing a review or not retiring a mandate? So my point is that there is a cost for action, but is there a way of quantifying the cost for inaction in terms of mandate review and renewal? I think it's important to make this information available at some point so that delegations who are sovereign indeed, as was pointed out by several of the briefers, will have the relevant information to make decisions in an intergovernmental context. Second point, also a question. Is there a way the Secretariat can share actually how many mandates have actually been retired over the last 80 years and in what areas of the three pillars, have these retired mandates taken place? I mean, obviously the Security Council has a very structured process and it's a much smaller body. The Human Rights Council, also much smaller than the General Assembly. Aquasoc as well, has a structured process. The General assembly, because these larger struggles with creating a structured process. But I think it will be good to see how many mandates have been retired over the last 80 years, in which principal organs and under which pillars. And a related question, how many retired mandates have come back on the agenda or to a new mandate? The reason I ask that question is that it's important to have a permeable system where mandates can be created and retired with fluidity, because right now a lot of delegations would be very concerned about retiring a mandate, because that may be the death of a certain issue. But we want to create a more fluid situation that mandates can be renewed or retired. It could come back very quickly if needed, so that we assure delegations that retiring mandate is not the end of an issue, but it could be a phase or it could be a pause. That's the second comment and question. My third question relates to consolidated reviews. I think USGuy Rider was talking about how consolidated reviews the exception rather than the norm. And could the Secretariat suggest a clustering of agenda items that could potentially be reviewed in a consolidated way in the future and present this to the consideration of Member States? We can then look at it. Either disagree with the Secretariat clustering, but I think the idea of a consolidated review of clusters of items with a view to just starting the review process, I think it's an important one. My last comment and question. I'm sorry, I think it was the presentations which have generated a lot of questions in my mind, relates to mandates which are minimally active. Obviously, a lot of mandates are being renewed for a variety of reasons. Politically, there is a need, there's a sense of urgency around certain issues, and some issues are just intractable, they need a longer time. But if the level of activity is so minimal as to create an implementation deficit, to quote the words of the Assistant Secretary General here on the podium, then the question arises for Member States if the implementation deficit, because the activity is so minimal, Member States are confronted with the question, either we provide additional resources or we retire the mandate, or we put in a serious way of reviewing how we do something. Again, that decision has to be made by Member States. So my question to the Secretariat is whether the Secretariat will be able to identify a list of mandates that in its view, in the Secretariat's view, faces a minimal level of activity and therefore suggests that there is considerable implementation deficit and therefore requires the review of members to take a decision either to provide additional resources or to restructure the way the mandates are designed or to retire the mandate.

**SGP**, Representative
So these are some questions and comments. Thank you very much co chairs.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank Singapore. I now give the floor to Australia.

**AUS**, Representative
Thank you very much indeed co chairs. And can I thank each of our briefers? It's really been a most valuable and instructive morning. I have two very quick questions. The first is really straightforward and it very much builds on guys briefing I think concerning what we do in the review space. I wonder whether there are potential examples of best practice review clauses out there because I do think when we think about how to go forward and really to build on Berhan's comments just a moment ago, when we're looking at review processes obviously budget is key but actually some really straightforward simple examples that are plug and play examples I think is what will help us make a difference. And that goes also I think to the notion of model resolutions, model mandate text to streamline processes. I had a second reflection when I listened to the OHCHR briefing for which I'm deeply grateful. Obviously in the human rights space where. We spend such a small amount of. Our budget on human rights and yet the nature of the work done is so important and the nature of the mandates in the human rights space is so important, I think we should have a think about what's the link between the mandates we have in the human rights space, our spend and the results. So I think it goes to those three interrelated issues which go very much to what many of us have been. Talking about this morning. So I I'd be interested in what that looks like. Thanks so much.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank Australia. I give the floor to the European Union.

**EU**, Representative
Thank you. Thank you co chairs and thanks also for the briefers for their updates and I think there's already a lot of good practices out in the system as it is just to confirm that in our view this reform should of course eventually result in a consolidation, streamlining and updating of existing mandates. And as well we know there are quite many and that includes an identification of mandates that have outlived their original purpose or completed their objectives. So what evidence based framework could we implement to align mandate reform with performance management? So I think what I'm asking is how can we measure impact? What role do we foresee for the pact for the future in that? Because that of course as we have been saying for A while is the what so how can we, how can we align the, you know, the impact assessment with that what system wide mandate can we system wide standard can we put in place for the review and should it be system wide or should it be organ specific, depending on which body of the UN adopted the mandate in the first place. We also have a question relating to external stakeholders. We feel there should be a place for external stakeholders in the review. But how is the Secretariat envisaging that if they were to develop sort of a review system for us or come with proposals. And finally on the Secretariat's commitment to enhancing communication and also involving digital platforms and tools. We appreciate that. And this concerns the facilitation of the identification of duplications, cross citations, similarities among mandates. We'd like to receive more details on that and on the concrete solutions that the Secretariat is thinking about and maybe also on that a technical briefing in the in the near future. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank the European Union. I give the floor to Liechtenstein to be followed by Malawi and then Costa Rica.

**LIE**, Representative
Liechtensteinstein, thank you very much. Co chairs, all protocol observed and many thanks to our panelists. Nonetheless on costing, I mean we have talked about this before. We think there should be a casting of every resolution, be it a new mandate or a renewed mandate. So I think that's similar to what. Our colleague from Singapore has said, has said before and that of course can also be looking back that we have an indication of how much the implementation has cost in the previous implementation period. I'm also curious if we can maybe because I think we're thinking in a way about the toolkit and about measures for the future. So thinking if there are attributes of mandates that we can identify that help us decide whether something requires a shorter or longer mandate review and along similar lines and I think echoing what our colleague from the U has just said can have indicators or benchmarks to, to measure impact but also relevance of mandates in the future also I mean there. Was a little bit on this on. The panel, but are there sort of recognized best practices in integrating review mechanisms during the initial mandate design phase? Thank you so much. Much. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Liechtenstein. I give the floor now to Malawi, then Costa Rica and then South Africa.

**MWI**, Representative
Chair considering that and thank you for the briefers. Considering that the world has become more dynamic and complex from social, political and economic perspectives. The mandate review mechanisms that have been shared appear to be more from within, from inside. And it looks right at. The existing processes and existing themes. And I'm happy to hear Indonesia has. Touched on what I'm trying to ask for the consolidated review of classes. And then there is another, I think. It was another country has asked about. The evidence based mandate review. My point is that the world out there has of late queried the relevance and impact of the un and this means that the social contract that the world has had with the UN has. Been eroded over time. So how can we make sure that the review, the mandate review is really taking into account these issues that are happening, the changes that are happening in. A more consolidated way rather than in a fragmented way. Because from what we have heard, everybody is doing it in their own silos. But probably at this time with UN80 initiative, we need a more consolidated and more overview, a more ego approach to this mandate review. Thank you very much. Thank you Malawi. I give the floor to Costa Rica and then South Africa.

**CRI**, Representative
Thank you Cal Chairs, we appreciate the brief. First, insights on the many nuances of. Mandate review on this topic allow me. To make some questions. The first one is what practices from bodies other than the General assembly should be brought to the General Assembly? Second, what efforts do the Secretaries of bodies other than the GA make to streamline mandates? And third, how can Member States help. Strengthen the role of secretariats? As a final comment, we need to acknowledge that is urgent to learn from. Across the system like principles and actions. Need to be system wide. I thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank Costa Rica. I give the floor to South Africa.

**ZAF**, Representative
Thank you co Chairs and thank you. To the panelists for the information provided this morning. South Africa has a few questions concerning the mandate review process. The first question relates to the report which states that more than 85% of active mandates lack instructions on review or termination? South Africa has in our previous deliberations raised the importance of the inclusion of sunset clauses in this regard. Should the inclusion of expiry clauses and review advisories not become standard in the stage of mandate design? Secondly, if a results based management mechanism is a measure is to measure accountability as well as the impact and collective achievement of our mandates, our core preoccupation of this discussion, would it not be crucial to have an effectively run uniform system wide performance management mechanism firmly in place to also evaluate the impact of activities? Thirdly, while South Africa agrees with the proposed solutions for system wide mandate reviews, should the use of such mechanisms not also include mention of the Joint Inspection Unit and the Committee for Program and Coordination? Finally, in setting up a harmonized system wide performance management mechanism, what would be the annual budgetary and human resource implications of ensuring the availability of consistent and predictable resources for the operationalization of Such a mechanism. Thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank South Africa. I give the floor to Mexico and then Qatar.

**MEX**, Representative
Thank you very much. All protocols observed. Thank you for the very important briefing and I would like to pose three quick questions. The report indicates that over 80%, 85% of active mandates lack clear instructions for review or termination. Could the Secretariat elaborate on the practical obstacles that prevent the systematic inclusion of review benchmarks or sunset clauses and how Member States might support the establishment of a more predictable review architecture? Another one is While several entities have advanced their result based management practices, significant variations persist across the system. So what steps are envisioned to harmonize methodologies and ensure comparability and coherence in performance reporting? And finally, the inclusion of expiration clauses for new mandates is identified as a best practice in the Secretariat's assessment. What categories of mandates would be most suitable for the introduction of sunset clauses and how might this practice be gradually expanded? Thank you very much.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank Mexico. I give the floor to Qatar and then China.

**QAT**, Representative
Thank you very much. I'd like to thank the Co Chairs for their leadership of this transparent, inclusive process and for all the briefers for their very informative information that they provided us with. So we engage in this mandate implementation review and exercising that enhancing coherence, reducing deployment, application and streamlining. Our first question would be regarding the practical tools available to improve the efficiency of our work across the Main Committees. Under the provision of paragraph 28A of resolution 79 327, the General assembly plenary first takes all required votes individually on draft resolutions or parts where a vote occurred in the Main Committee and only thereafter adopts and one gavel all other resolutions and decisions that were approved in the Committee without a vote? Could the mandate implementation review explore whether this approach, adopting all non contested draft resolutions in a single action during the Plenary could be expanded or applied more systematically across the Main Committees? In particular, could it help reduce repetitive procedural steps, minimize scheduling burdens during the plenary adoption period and support a more streamlined, predictable and efficient resolutions? Second question is on the relevance and coherence of existing mandates across the Main Committees. How will the mandate implementation review identify mandates that remain relevant, those that require updating or consolidation, and those that may no longer contribute effectively to the work of the organization to guide Member States in assessing application of efforts? Mandates that predate major frameworks such as the 2030 Agenda, mandates whose output puts no longer translate into impactful results and proposals that add to procedural burden without advancing shared priorities. Coaches Guitar looks forward to supporting your leadership and continuing this important exercise. Thank you I thank Qatar, I give the floor to China and then Finland.

**CHN**, Representative
Thank you Co Chairs. I thank the briefers for their insightful briefings. I have three questions. First, effective assessment of the mandate delivery is a basis for mandate review. So how does the UN system or. Is planning to measure the relevant progress and results? What are the key dimensions and quantitative indicators used in such assessments? The second question is with regard to a suggestion made in the SG report which is make full use of the existing mechanism to streamlining mandates. So how many specific outputs has SG recommended to terminate over the 80 years? What are the selecting criteria for such inputs and why are the reasons. What are the reasons why this mechanism is not very often used? The third is with regard to Security Council. This year in March, Security Council has successfully done a streamlining of Council meetings. What has GATT done in facilitating such streamlining process? I thank you.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
I thank China, floor to Finland and then latvia.

**FIN**, Representative
Thank you Mr. Chair. In particular, I wish to thank you for a very useful mandate source registry provided by the Secretariat. Now, inspired by your presentation and in particular by the presentation by Executive Director Inger Andersen of unep, could a similar interactive result dashboard on mandate implementation progress be provided by 2ease member state review of mandates? This should optimally also include information about resource use. Once mandate is nearing completion of expected outcomes or when no progress is being made, relevant body could be triggered to consider review, recalibration or retirement of the mandate. This would enhance transparency to Member States. Now, for obvious reasons, when considering systematic mandate reviews, we need to also recognize the diversity of mandates, their nature, size and expected duration. And I'm thinking here notably about the mandates under the Human Rights Pillar, as was very well presented by the ESG of ohcr. Thank you very much.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you Finland. I give the floor to Latvia to be followed by the Republic of Korea.

**LVA**, Representative
Thank you to Co Chairs for convening this important session. Also thank you to all briefers for their comprehensive briefings. This is very valuable and important. Allow me to ask three following questions. First, one on mandate review coherence across the UN system. Some similar questions were asked by EU delegation and Costa Rica. But in addition to that, having experience of both co chairing the ECOSOC HLPF review process as well as chairing the Force Committee in the previous session, we consider that coherence and follow through is of great importance among all UN organs in regards to mandate review. In your view, what are the key aspects of possible coordination to ensure coherence and follow through across the whole UN system? Second, on the role of the General Committee. General Committee has an advantage of its cross cutting nature. Could we use this Committee to pursue efforts at optimizing the mandate system and the final one on Main Committee's mandate cycle mandates usually being created well in advance of the session and this leaves the future chairs in a predetermined position without much of autonomy. Could how this could be addressed in order to equip Chairs with some tools to be able to influence work of. The Committee in session. Thank you. I thank Latvia I give the floor to the Republic of Korea and then Malaysia.

**KOR**, Representative
Thank you Chair for this opportunity. I will have a quick question question on scad can you elaborate on how Security Council has substantially reduced and consolidated agenda numbers and how do you manage it to keep it that way? Maybe we can learn some lessons from in terms of methodology and also another question is Secretary General has already authority to recommend to the General Assembly a list of outdated deliverables for discontinuation. I wonder whether we can operationalize or reactivate this process as a feedback to the membership. So do you see any obstacle or reluctance or no incentives for the Secretariat to do so?

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
Thank you. I thank the Republic of Korea. I give the floor to the final Speaker. Malaysia.

**MYS**, Representative
Thank you Co Chair. Thank you to the briefers. I'll be Brief in my one question. For USG Rider it relates to paragraph 60 of the Secretary General's report on the Mandate Implementation Review. Specifically, I'd like to focus on the review regarding the Secretary General's Special Envoys under work package number 11, I believe under the Action Plan.

**IAHWG** | Brian Wallace, Co-Chair
